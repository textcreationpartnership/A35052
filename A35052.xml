            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The excellency of Riches alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in reſpect of the good effects thereof. Many good and excellent effects and benefits doe often ſpring from this fountaine of Riches; Such as are, good education and learning, Alſo Friends, Lovers, Acquaintance, (The rich hath many friends, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.20.) Likewiſe Honour, Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Reſpect, Servants, Counſellors: Alſo faire and pleaſant Houſes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Gardens, Fields, and Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of many kindes, The choyſeſt kind of Dyet, both Meates and Drinkes;

                  <p>Riches alſo may be imployed to many good uſes and purpoſes, as well to Gods glory, as to the good of our ſelves and others, The ſame may ſerve and be uſed to the advancement of all Piety and Vertue. They may excite and encourage us to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; to thankfulneſſe, to charity, to the Love of God who gives them, To eſpie, ſeeke and enjoy the Riches of a divine Soule, which are all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Graces, Joyes and Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and thoſe eternall moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Treaſures which are in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in heaven. But of this more in the fifth Section of this Partition.</p>
                  <p>And wee ſhall the rather well
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44773:10"/> eſteeme of riches, and more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, ſee the worth and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thereof, if we conſider the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Poverty and want of Riches.</p>
                  <p>Poverty makes men ſubject to the ſaddeſt indurances amongſt men, To be reproach't, diſdained; and that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even by their kindred &amp; neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, (<hi>Prov.</hi> 14.30.) though perhaps they be well deſerving; And their good parts alſo to be not regarded, but rather deſpiſed, only becauſe they are Poore. The wiſedome of the poore is deſpiſed &amp; his words are not heard, <hi>Eccles</hi> 9.19. So as oftentimes their wiſdome is (by this mad world) eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med but folly. Poverty makes many men to ſuffer hunger and thirſt, cold, and want, to be lyable to the moſt common and grievous oppreſſions, wrongs, &amp; abuſes of cruel men. There is not in the world ſuch another object of pitty, as the poore miſerable man. Oh; I wonder at the multitude of men in the world that can ſo inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, oppreſſe and abuſe poore miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44773:10"/> men as we uſually ſee they do; the rather I wonder thereat ſince God might juſtly have made us ſuch, and more miſerable then they: what flinty &amp; maligne hearts have ſuch men who can willingly rejoyce and adde to the calamities of them who are already e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven nothing els but an heap of miſery.</p>
                  <p>Though Poverty to ſuch as make a good uſe thereof is a happy eſtate, and a pious wiſe man may be ſweetly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented even therein, as ſhalbe declared in the fourth Section, yet we ſee too commonly that to many men in the world the ſame is a miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For by reaſon of Poverty, many men as alſo their children become ill tutor'd, rude, uncivill, Yea Poverty is an occaſion that ſome men turne Rogues, Theeves, Villains, that others will flatter, diſſemble, lie, ſweare, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, and proſtitute themſelves to divers hatefull vices and impieties, alſo repine, grieve, and ſome even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to make themſelves away through deſperate griefe and ſorrow.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:44773:11"/>
                  <p>Riches therefore being ſo excellent and beneficiall, as hath beene ſaid, and the want thereof ſo irkeſome and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, let us by all meanes endeavour to avoyd ſuch courſes as conſume and waſte Riches, and to uſe and take ſuch wayes as may gaine and encreaſe the ſame: of which in the next Section.</p>

Hee becommeth poore that dealeth with a flacke hand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.4. Alſo Pride, high-mindedneſſe and vaine-glory; which is the hinderance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44773:11"/> of many mens eſtate, and the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome, who to ſhew themſelves magnificent forſooth, doe live much above their eſtate and degree, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſome of our young Heires, who after their covetous fathers deceaſe, doe creep into Satin and Pluſh, turne Roarers, Blades, Gallants, learne to ſwagger, ſmoake, drinke ſtoutly, ſpend bravely, like Emperours, as they ſay, and to cry, Hang money, fly Ducke, &amp;c. So as, the one part of their eſtate they hang on their backes, and the other part they turne downe their throats. So all riotous courſes, all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and too coſtly banquetting, tipling, roaring, ſmoaking, whoring, immoderate gaming (as at Cards and Dice) for money, alſo hawkes, hounds, horſes, and overcoſtly Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which doe much hinder many mens eſtate, who otherwiſe in a life time might be much more rich and wealthy. Such courſes have been the bane of many whole Families, and of much poſſeſſions.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44773:12"/>
                  <p>Flattering fellowes alſo, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſites (who are eſpecially reſident and to be met withall in Tavernes and Taphouſes) are much to be taken heed of; who by inſinuating into mens mindes, and applauding their ſayings and actions doe often deceive many (otherwiſe) wiſe men, who being tickled with their cunning applauſes, doe ſuffer themſelves by ſuch men to be poſſeſt even from themſelves, and to be carried away by them to all rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and prodigall courſes. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if there be any <hi>Dallilah</hi> under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, 'tis ill company, if we will be led away and rul'd by them, they will ſtrangely blinde us, and betray us, Theſe flattering Jackes doe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially worke upon our young Fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd fantaſticke Prodigals, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten abuſe them into ill bargaines, and cauſe them to lend them money, give them gifts, to become their Sureties, pay their debts, and lead them to all manner of riot, prodigallity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and in the end perhaps cheat
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44773:12"/> or laugh at them.</p>
                  <p>You braine-ſicke Hotſpurs, Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Heires; 'Twere good for you if you were wiſer then to be flatter'd and gull'd out of your lands and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues by ſuch Syccophants and idle flagging companions, that fawne and ſeeke to feed on you, as the little bird <hi>Trochilus</hi> in the Jawes of the <hi>Crocodile;</hi> Be not Carrion for ſuch Crowes to prey upon; You will at laſt ('tis like) have occaſion to curſe them as <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> did their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in their greateſt exigents. Know that though you ſhould ſpend all you have upon theſe Canibals, though they ſhould fawne and feed upon you like Harpies and Fleſhwoolves, yet in the end you ſhall ſcarce have as much releefe and reſpect from them as the Prodigall from his former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, ſcarce ſo much as huskes or ſwines meat, but rather ſcornes, ſcoffes and deriſion.</p>
                  <p>They are inconſiderate men, and ill ſtewards of a good eſtate, who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44773:13"/> away the ſame eſpecially in ill, company. He does Bounty injury that makes her as common as a Strumpet by ſhewing her too much abroad; and ſo make her and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe but derided by the wiſer ſort of men. Who gives or ſpends too much, more then his eſtate will allow, muſt fall or deſiſt with ſhame. To live well of a little is much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, then to ſpend a great deale vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it is not good to make our too la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh kindneſſe to others to be cruelty to our ſelves. Though it be good to give, and freely to ſuch as are in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and in a good manner to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall to our friends, yet a wiſe man will give or ſpend no more then the ſafety of his eſtate will allow. Hee hath the beſt fame that keepes his eſtate, and yet not too niggardly.</p>
                  <p>In expences therefore, as I thinke 'tis not good to be too pinching, ſo alſo I thinke it bad to be too prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall: yet I thinke it better to be too ſparing then too profuſe; though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44773:13"/> neither of them good. 'Tis no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to make our ability our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe to ſayle by; There is better uſe to be made of our talents then to caſt them away vainely, we ought rather to employ them for gaine.</p>
                  <p>Let us take heed alſo that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers doe not picke our Purſes, as the Eagle did the meate out of the opened Oyſter, and leave us onely ſhels inſtead of meat to feed on, leſt we have need of as ſtrong patience to digeſt this as the Oſtridge hath a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to digeſt Iron.</p>
                  <p>There is a farre better and cheaper way to reconcile differences, then by Lawyers, namely by mediation of friends and arbitrators. Yet if a man be forced to goe to Law, and have a very good cauſe, I thinke it the ſafeſt way (even for his eſtate, as well as for his credit and for example) to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent therein, and goe on ſoundly. But this going to Law, eſpecially here in England, is ſo tedious, ſo irkeſome, ſo ſervile, ſo coſtly, as that it ſhould
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44773:14"/> be a wiſe mans laſt remedy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.</p>
                  <p>To proceed. So alſo borrowing of money and paying intereſt, unneſſary gifts, lending of mony and ſuertyſhip have impoveriſhed many thouſand men. All which, and the like ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that conſume and hinder Riches are to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>And further, let us take and uſe all ſuch good wayes and courſes as may encreaſe or preſerve our eſtates here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The uſuall meanes whereby Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are preſerved and encreaſed are ſuch as follow.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to be diligent, forward and induſtrious in our Callings, and in ſuch affaires as we undertake; The hand of the diligent maketh Rich, <hi>Prou.</hi> 10 4. Such men who are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, ſtirring ſpirits in the world, are much more like to be Rich, then ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, careleſſe men; Induſtry is never wholly unfruitfull, if it bring not joy with incomming profit, yet 'tis like it will baniſh vice, and idle waſtefull
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44773:14"/> courſes out of our buſied mindes. I have often found hurt of idleneſſe, but never of a lawfull buſineſſe; even that which is not profitable in it ſelfe is yet often made ſo by imployment. And diligence commonly brings a recompence that ſweetens it. I have ſeldome knowne an induſtrious man want, but rather he ſtill increaſeth in Riches. With what proportion'd ſucceſſe doth that family commonly flouriſh where an induſtrious diſcreet guide ſteereth in an ordered courſe, as if ſome good Angell were alwayes aſſigned with bleſſings in his hand to crowne diligence.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the better to thrive and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in Riches, it is good not to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect but to take time and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to ſtrike while the iron is hot, as the Proverbe goes, to uſe all good meanes to obtaine ſome profitable grants, offices, preferments, and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſuch as they are moſt fit for and capable of, and may by any good meanes accompliſh either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44773:15"/> friends, or money, either in lawfull caſes; Alſo by procuring certificates, or letters commendatory from ſuch as have power therein, or otherwiſe, according to the nature of the buſineſſe. It is true indeed that a modeſt man, his deſires are more limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then his fortunes, which though meane, yet he is contented, thinkes the ſame preferment enough, and doth ſomething to deſerve this; Hee is hardly drawne to ſeek more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though he truely deſerves it; But now ſince in this Age there are a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of impudent men (and ſome of them worthleſſe) who putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forth, ſeeking firſt, and ſtanding in the way, preferment ſtumbles on them. Therefore many worthy men, as they are unpreferred, ſo are they like to be, unleſſe they can put on a brazen face, which although it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes them not, yet they thinke it not amiſſe to make a vertue of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                  <p>Let therfore the worthy and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44773:15"/> Lawyer and Phyſitian, if they meane to get preferment, uſe all good and honeſt meanes to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>By theſe generous and noble pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Phyſicke and the Law, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men attain to abundance of Riches; wherefore it is that many Schollers apply themſelves in all haſte to one of theſe.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe ſuch men have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and opportunity, may uſe all good meanes to gain preferment and riches under the King, Queene, Noblemen, ſuch eſpecially as are in places of greateſt dignity and authority, and beare the greateſt Offices.</p>
                  <p>The Farmer and Husbandman may likewiſe uſe all good meanes to gaine ſome good Leaſe or Tenancy, which are moſt uſually to be gotten of ſome conſcionable Landlord, or ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſſe prodigale young Heire. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of ſome Corporation or Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, of ſome Colledge, the Church, or under the Crowne; Of which be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44773:16"/> that may be good preferment, for a Gentleman. And ſo of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers..</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes in ſome reſpects not amiſſe alſo that the Batchellour get as rich a wife as he may with love, or one by whom he may gaine preferment. 'Tis like the Richeſt are ſometimes or ought to be beſt educated; And though ſome proud Coxecombes perchance will be the more malepart for their Riches, yet 'tis like a good wife will not be the worſe for a good portion, And if ſhe be an ill one, ſhe had need of goods to make her better.</p>
                  <p>And further to this purpoſe. It is good for ſuch as meane to thrive to looke into their eſtate to know what they are worth, and to take care that they be not waſted by ſervants and officers. If a man doe but ſave, 'tis like he ſhall encreaſe. And if he have the patience to attend but every little good occaſion of profit, he may eaſily thrive; Theſe little occaſions come thicker and faſter then others, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44773:16"/> though they ſeeme but ſmall, yet in time the ſame will amount to a good ſumme of Riches.</p>
                  <p>Alſo to conſider of neceſſary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and expences; and to live within Compaſſe. So drawing in their eſtate as it may be leaſt for ſhew and moſt for profit; as a man that is worth 500 l. a yeere, may well and in good ſort live after the rate of two or three hundred, and gaine the reſt. And ſo of a greater eſtate; and likewiſe ſuch men whoſe eſtate is meane and little, It is better for them to live rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, then either levell or above it. To fal in eſtate is a ſhame &amp; diſgrace, but to riſe is honor &amp; praiſe-worthy.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile we have thus viewed the excellency and benefits of Riches, the miſeries of the want thereof, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44773:17"/> wayes to gaine and encreaſe the ſame. Let us by all means take heed of their abuſes and dangers, which otherwiſe will hinder our happineſſe therein, and on the contrary bring upon us much miſchiefe and miſery.</p>
                  <p>On the one ſide the dangers of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are, Pride, Arrogancy, Diſdaine, Inſolency, Preſumption, Sloth, Slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſſe, Delicacy, and all Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which the ſame occaſioneth to many men, ſo as their Riches doe but ſerve thereby to encreaſe their miſery and perdition. Many thouſand men uſe their Riches to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining &amp; countenancing of riot, luſt, Intemperance, Idleneſſe, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſenſuality, and evill pleaſures (of the miſeries and remedies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I intend to write in due place) So as it had been better for them to have ſuffered irkeſome poverty.</p>
                  <p>That man therfore who wold be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in his Riches, muſt by all means avoyd theſe dangers and abuſes therof.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide; the danger of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44773:17"/> Riches is that Common vice of many rich men, namely, Covetouſneſſe. Let us, if we meane to be happy in our Riches, take heed that we plunge not our ſelves into this unſatiable, ſordid, and miſerable vice, leſt that with <hi>Shemei,</hi> while we ſeeke our ſervant we loſe our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>How many men are there now in the world that doe quite and cleane loſe the felicity of a quiet life for to ſet up their happineſſe (though meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaginary) in the amaſſement of Riches. And if heaven heare their covetous deſires with deſigne to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them, and give them ſome favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſucceſſe to their Cares, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come then even Idolaters indeed of thoſe treaſures which before they adored but in hope; And ſo become miſerable by too ardently deſiring that which otherwiſe might doe them good.</p>
                  <p>It is now in our Age almoſt as it was in the Prophet <hi>Ieremies</hi> time; Even from the meaneſt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44773:18"/> men are given to covetouſneſſe, and to deale falſely, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6.10. Let us therefore view this vice and the effects thereof: But firſt to prevent miſtakes and Cavils; let me ſay that in the enſuing diſcourſe againſt Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I doe not meane that honeſt and neceſſary deſire of Riches, and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to gaine the ſame (which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man ought to have for the good of himſelfe, family, and others) which may be called honeſt frugality, and is commendable in all men; inſomuch as no men are more praiſe-worthy and happy in this reſpect then ſuch as frugally deſire Riches, and provide for themſelves and theirs; But now to define what I intend by Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and proceed. Covetouſneſſe is an over-greedy, unſatiable, niggardly, ſottiſh, and ravenous deſire of Riches, from which ſpringeth abundance of evils and miſeries; The due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wherof is remedy ſufficient to flight our diſorderly affections from the ſame; Let us therfore view them.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44773:18"/>
                  <p>Covetouſneſſe is the root of all evill, (Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) from thence often ſprings deceit, contentions, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Simony, Vſury, thefts, quarrels, ſuites, ſtrifes, treaſons and murders.</p>
                  <p>Inſomuch that if a mans heart be very deepely ſet on Couetouſneſſe, he will commit any vice or wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to effect his ravenous deſires, Like that Italian Monke, who being corrupted with money, poyſon'd the Emperour, <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh. Or as that Citizens ſonne of Venice, whoſe father having committed a crime and hid himſelfe, a reward was appointed by the State to him that ſhould bring his head; Whereupon his ſonne ſlew him and brought his head to the Duke. Or as <hi>Iudas</hi> for money betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>The Riches of the world if too much beloved, do attract and draw the eie of the ſoule from it ſelfe, or at leaſt ſo blindes the ſame as it cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch good actions as it ought either to the glory of God, the good
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44773:19"/> of others, or it ſelfe: for Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe baniſheth out of the ſoule the moſt ſublime and heavenly graces, nobleneſſe of ſpirit, humanity, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, love, kindneſſe, mutuall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, naturall affection, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. It turnes the ſoule into a low, earthy dunghill, temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cauſeth men to become very muckwormes and ſlaves to money. It draweth away the minde from all more excellent pleaſures, and ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it that, it cannot ſee them. Tell the covetous man of the choyſeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights on Earth; yea, of Heaven it ſelfe, yet hee is ſo blinde and brutiſh as to thinke all a kinde of madneſſe and folly that is above his low ſordid temper and diſpoſition. So as Covetouſneſſe bereaveth a man, or at leaſt hindereth him in all the pleaſures of the earth and of heaven alſo; and which is moſt ſtrange, of that which he ſo much deſires, even the pleaſures of Riches themſelves; for he regardeth not what felicity hee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44773:19"/> may derive from the ſubſtance which he doth poſſeſſe, but ever thinketh how well he ſhould be if he had ſome great matter which he hath not; and the want thereof almoſt continually grieves him; even like children and fooles, who will pule and whine for a toy they want or long for, of which they are more ſenſible then of all the preſent good or future hope they have or may enjoy. So that according to the Proverbe, The covetous man ſels his horſe to get Hay; which when he hath t doth him little or no good. He doth even contemne and neglect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all other good pleaſures and felicities to gain this of Riches, which when he hath he neither uſes well nor enjoyes, but ſtill remaines diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly unſatisfied. The more he hath, the more he deſires; even his Riches are to him but as drinke in a dropſie; for as thoſe increaſe, ſo his deſires are ſtill the more enlarged, even as the grave, the wombe, the earth, the fire, which are never ſatisfied. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44773:20"/> 16. His heart may be compared to thoſe leane Kine (which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaw in his dreame) who devoured the fat Kine and were never the fuller. That which hee hath is not regarded for want of that which he hath not, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he poſſeſſe abundance. So Covetouſneſſe is an unſatiable deſire which continually (as with hunger) gnawes and diſcontents the minde.</p>
                  <p>Though Covetous men have Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Lands, Riches, Revenues, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, Vineyards, Fields enough, yea, abundance (as <hi>Ahab</hi> King of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el had) yet (as <hi>Ahabs</hi> did at <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard) their eyes will envie and looke obliquely at their neighbours goods, houſes, lands, &amp;c. and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their teeth will water at that which their noſe moſt drops over, that which lies moſt pat in their way, very neere and fit for them. They are even (as he was ſicke in the ſuddes and ſullens for want therof, and lack ſome politick <hi>Iezabel</hi> to make them a caudle, though of the blood of the Vinetor and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44773:20"/> Grape of the Vineyard; ſome wiſe Lawyer, cunning ſnap, or politicke pate of their owne, to deviſe a way to get the ſame, either by hooke or by crooke, as they ſay, though the Devill be in the Councell, either by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, extortion, or couzening circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. So envie alſo pines the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man.</p>
                  <p>Alſo cares, plots, and ravenous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to get Riches, doe alwayes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe him; And what baſe offices, paines therein, and reproaches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as alſo what ſordid and niggardly pinching of himſelfe will he not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to ſave and gaine a little money? Feares alſo of looſing what he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, grieves him. He is alwayes ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, grudging, complaining, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented. Sorrow and griefe alſo in parting from Riches doth greatly vex him. He can ſcarce afford himſelf and family neceſſaries without brawling, pining and grieving. The often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of loſſes and expences paſt, doth alſo much trouble him. In
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44773:21"/> a bad yeere, or at ſome great loſſe, hee could even affoord to make himſelfe away. As old <hi>Hermon</hi> who dreaming he had ſpent a ſumme of money, for griefe, hang'd himſelfe; Or as that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous <hi>Phidon,</hi> who being faln into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparation for a great loſſe, went to buy a haltar to hang himſelfe withall, but finding the price too dear, leapt into a River. It is reported of another who being ſicke, was told hee muſt take Phyſicke, or die, and being demanded of the Phyſitian, ten ſhillings to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, anſwered, the ſame might better be ſaved to defray the charges of his buriall; To which purpoſe is that ancient Epitaph,
<q>
                        <l>Here lies Father Sparges,</l>
                        <l>Who dyed to ſave charges.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe covetous cares, feares and griefes, doe often diſtemper the body; alſo they are an occaſion of reſtleſſe unpleaſing, and interrupted ſleepe, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and drying the body, cauſing in ſome men a weariſh and pale conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and ſhortning their lives. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44773:21"/> ſometimes by accident alſo covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may cauſe loſſe of Riches, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, of health, and of life it ſelfe. <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi</hi> loſt his health by reaſon of his covetouſneſſe, <hi>Achan, Iudas, Ananias, Saphira</hi> their lives. <hi>Mauritious</hi> the Emperour was deptived of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire for his covetouſneſſe. King <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> of <hi>Lydia</hi> by ſeeking to encreaſe his Riches, loſt his Kingdome, and after his life. So as it appeares that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Riches doe covetous men no more good than <hi>Achans, Midas,</hi> or the <hi>Tholouſe</hi> gold, or <hi>Iudas</hi> his thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſilver to the poſſeſſours.</p>
                  <p>When age and ſickneſſe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and appeareth to the covetous man, he is ſtung at the heart to thinke he muſt part with his Riches, which addes to all his paines and griefes and perchance kils him the ſooner. So hee leaves his Riches (ſaith God by his Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi>) and at his end ſhall be a foole, <hi>Ierem.</hi> 17.11. Such men therefore as meane to bee happy in reſpect of their Riches, muſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44773:22"/> take Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> counſell, who ſaith; Let your converſation be without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and be content with ſuch things as you have, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.5. Let us then baniſh out of our ſoules this low ſordid and miſerable vice of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe, and endevour to ſettle our mindes in a contented and feareleſſe condition; Of which in the enſuing Section.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44773:23"/> or arguing divine providence. Hee whoſe will ſubmits to Gods will, lives ever contented. He is moſt rich and happy. And why then ſhould we not ſubmit to his will, the rather ſince hee wils all things that are good.</p>
                  <p>All things worke to the good of them that love God, ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> To ſuch as relye on and truſt him in all things, even croſſes and poverty is ableſſed eſtate, and furthereth them in the happy way to heaven. And it is no matter which way we goe (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through adverſity or proſperity, riches or poverty) ſo we come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>Further to this purpoſe that wee may not too much feare the loſſe of Riches, if we poſſeſſe them, nor be too much grieved or dejected for their want; but rather rejoyce and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, even in loſſes and poverty, let us conſider (firſt concerning loſſes and croſſes in Riches) That 'tis good for us ſometimes to be croſt. Nothing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44773:23"/> would be more tedious and noyſome to our minds, then to be glutted with continuall proſperities, as with Iolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. What a proud and fooliſh thing wold man grow to be, if he ſhold alwaies attain his deſires in the world, and never be croſt; ſurely he would in time forget goodneſſe, and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. How farre, how ſecure, ſhould we run on in vice if ſome croſſes did not ſometimes checke us and make us rememher our ſelves. There are ſome few perchance whoſe pathes are waſh't with Butter, and the Roſe Bud crownes them even continually. They ſeldome meet with loſſes and croſſes, but how dangerous a thing is it to live in oyled vice, when her wayes are made ſlippery therewith and leade to ruine and miſery. And without doubt that is not onely the beſt, but the pleaſanteſt life that is ſprinkled with the Salt of ſome croſſes; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this even proſperity and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures would be ſoone ranke, tainted, ſtale, and corrupted; and we ſhould be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44773:24"/> even cloyd, and perchance glutted therewith.</p>
                  <p>Some croſſes, ſorrowes, loſſes and diſcontents doe increaſe, quicken, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ighten both our ſoules and our joyes; when does joy reliſh more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and ſweeter then after croſſes and miſery are paſt? And oftentimes thoſe ſo farre doe us good, as they make us better, more circumſpect, induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, couragious, wiſer, livelier ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then ever before; ſo as without them we ſhould want much of the joyes and proſperity we have. I have very often obſerved in my ſelfe and ſome others, that thoſe croſſes which in reaſon we thought would have done us much hurt, have yet bin occaſion of very much good to us. So as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares it is uſually a fit mixture of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity with proſperity, that makes both good and pleaſant to us, and our lives the happier ever after; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men after ſome (though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance ſmall) loſſes, croſſes and wants, become thereby ſo induſtrious and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44773:24"/> circumſpect ever after, as they grow alſo very much the richer thereby in a lives time, as well as the more joyfull and happy.</p>
                  <p>However let us be contented, and even ſcorne to be of ſo fraile and low a temper as to be impatient at every loſſe and croſſe which happens; the rather ſince no man lives without them ſometimes. How contented was <hi>Thales</hi> and <hi>Bias</hi> at the loſſe of their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches? <hi>Fabricius, Seranius, Marcus Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others have made themſelves merry with their loſſes. <hi>Zeno</hi> thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God after his ſhipwracke. So let us endevour to he contented.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhould loſe ſomething, yet let us looke to what is left, and let us rejoyce and be thankfull that we have loſt no more, and that we have yet ſomething left, perhaps ſufficient, and much more then many others who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame better then we. If we ſhould ſhould loſe all, yet Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is infinite plenty; Divine graces are eternall Treaſures, if wee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44773:25"/> have theſe, they are better then all the Riches in the world.</p>
                  <p>And now concerning poverty it ſelfe; It is eſteemed a very peaceable and quiet eſtate. One ſaith, that many wiſe men have ſeemed to embrace a quiet poore eſtate as ſome divine thing.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour himſelfe was poore on earth. Many of the Saints of God have beene willingly poore. How pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and contented was <hi>Iob</hi> at the loſſe of his riches, in his poverty. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> could ſay, <hi>Silver and gold have we none,</hi> The Devill ſaith, <hi>All this will I give thee if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me.</hi> How fooliſh are their conceits then who eſteeme a man the better and happier for riches without grace; and grace wee ſee is ſufficient to make a man ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and heavenly as to be a Saint, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riches, as well as with it; and ſo to make poore men herres of heaven.</p>
                  <p>Many Phi oſophers and wiſe men have beene voluntarily poore. <hi>Crates</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44773:25"/> threw his Riches into the ſea, becauſe he ſaw the ſame hindered his quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.. <hi>Marcus Curius, Phocian, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pemen, Cinon, Anaxarchus, Anacreon, Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocrates,</hi> and all the Stoikes, <hi>Zeno, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, Cleanthes,</hi> and divers others have eſteemed poverty a happy conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and preferred the ſame before much riches. And the rather becauſe riches to many men become ſnares and baites to vice and wickeneſſe, and hinder men ofttimes in goodneſſe; and he that is free from the cares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to riches, hath the more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to attend the divine and waightier affaires of the ſoule. Therefore many both Chriſtians and Philoſophers, out of the greatneſſe of their courage, have endevoured to deſpiſe riches and forſaken them, though perchance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably to diſcharge themſelves of the good uſe and exerciſe of many good duties and vertues that might be performed there by. But to goe on.</p>
                  <p>Although it be more praiſe-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to mount up to heaven through
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44773:26"/> many difficulties and temptations then otherwiſe; yet as it ſeemes pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is an eaſier way to heaven, which our Saviour implyes, ſaying, it is hard for a rich man to enter into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Marke</hi> 10. Yet true it is, that as it is more hard and difficult, ſo it is more commendable and glorious for a rich man to be pious &amp; vertuous. But indeed it is even rare to ſee rich men religious, for while the earth allowes them ſuch pleaſures they make it their heaven, and looke for no other; who wonders to ſee them neglect the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter when they dote upon the worſe. And riches oftentimes alſo are occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vice and wick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>dneſſe, and by our ill uſing of them, become even as ſnares of Satan to make us neglect God and goodneſſe, and hecome more evill and vitious. And hereby many rich men doe like Envie exttract evill out of good, their riches encreaſe their miſery.</p>
                  <p>How dangerous riches are to many men in this kinde, See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44773:26"/> 
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.22. <hi>and</hi> 19.23. <hi>Marke</hi> 10.23, 24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10 <hi>Iam.</hi> 5. and many other places in the ſacred Scriptures. So that it ſeemes, 'tis a greater danger to be very rich then very poore, for Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches oft times make men loſe good wayes, but poverty keepes them in the right pathes.</p>
                  <p>Poore men are commonly more free from idleneſſe, luxury, and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance then rich men, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from ſuch Aches, Paines, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and loathſome diſeaſes, as are incident and often cauſed thereby to many rich men: and alſo from pride, vaine, glory, inſolency, ambition, ſuſpition, feares, cares, complaints, contentions, peeviſhneſſe, diſcontents, diſturbances, and all ſuch vexations as many rich men are uſually poſſeſt with, who (like <hi>Haman, Eſther</hi> 3.5. and 5.9.13.) are commonly vext at every triflle, whereas poore men are uſually more contented with all things, more vertuous, more meeke,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44773:27"/> feareleſſe, free, and happy men; and ſeldome troubled with any more important thoughts then how to finde meanes to paſſe their time in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities whereunto they are already habituated, and which are by cuſtome made eaſie, yea, even pleaſant to them. They ſeldome envie or repine after others fortunes, as being equally eſtranged both from their knowledge and reach; in which reſpects alſo they may be ſtiled happy men. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſafe and at quiet, as it were in a harbor, while great rich men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to danger, as it were in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, floating on the maine Ocean.</p>
                  <p>The health of the body and the contentment of the minde are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reall riches in the world; and we ſee that poore men are commonly more healthy then idle intemperate rich men, and have better ſtomacks; their courſe fare taſtes as well to them as the rich mans dainties. Their cloth ſuite becomes them as well and keeps their healthy bodies as warme as the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44773:27"/> gallants bravery, and they are as well pleaſed therewith. The poore man and woman laughes at the gallants ſlaſht ſute with gold lace, and new odde faſhions, at the Madams ſtrange attires, at her naked breaſts and armes, at the ſpots in her face, &amp; thinks them proud, fooliſh, wilde and phantaſtick.</p>
                  <p>He is really the richeſt man that is moſt contented, and moſt rejoyceth in that which he hath though it be but competency, but a little; Hee that hath a minde contentedly good, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes in it boundleſſe poſſeſſions. And to view the world; Who whiſtles out more content, and ſings more merrily then the low-fortun'd Countreyman, the painefull Labourer, and the honeſt Plowman, and who (ſay they) are better Common-wealthes men then we; yea, even the Cobler under his ſtall will merrily chant away his time and his worke. So it appeares that many poore men ſing, whiſtle, laugh, are merry and rejoyce at their worke, while many rich men are ſullen, melancholly, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44773:28"/> droope in idleneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Who enjoyes more ſweetneſſe in pleaſure than they which gaine it by induſtry and paines. Thoſe fowles and fiſhes taſte beſt which we kill our ſelves, when wee travell a birding or fiſhing. That bread taſtes beſt which men labour for themſelves. And how doe many poore labouring men eate their bread with joy, and their healthy ſtomackes doe well digeſt the ſame, while many rich mens ſtomacks w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> are corrupted by idleneſſe and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, doe even loath their owne dainties. Yea, even the very ſleepe of him that laboureth and travelleth is ſweet (ſaith the wiſe man) but (ſaith he) the ſatiety and abundance of the rich will not ſuffer him to ſleepe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.12.</p>
                  <p>How happy then is the contented man, yea, though he be poore. And me thinkes <hi>Crato</hi> ſhew'd a braver ſpirit when hee danc'd and laught in his thredbare Clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ke and his Wallet at his backe, then <hi>Alexander</hi> when hee
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44773:28"/> wept that he had not ſuch a huge beaſt as the Empire of this world to govern, and a richer world to conquer and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe. So <hi>Crato</hi> wiſely ſeem'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, what <hi>Alexander</hi> cry'd for.</p>
                  <p>So it appeares that many poore men are commonly more Pious, more vertuous, more healthy and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented then many rich men; and though many rich men are wiſe in their owne conceits, <hi>Prov</hi> 28.11. yet wealth without wit, and without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt worth and honeſty, is but as a rich ſaddle to ride a foole or a knave in; and a poore man that hath underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſearches him out, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.11. he laughes at him in his ſleeve, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temnes him. King <hi>David</hi> ſaith, God ſhall deſtroy the wicked man, he ſhall take him from his riches, he ſhall plucke him from his dwelling, and root him out of the Land of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. The righteous man alſo ſhall ſee this and feare, and ſhall laugh him to ſcorne, and ſay, Loe this is the man that tooke not God for his ſtrength, but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44773:29"/> truſted unto the multitude of his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſtrengthened himſelfe in his wickedneſſe; but as for me I am a greene Olive in the houſe of God, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.6, 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Thus the poore man may comfort himſelfe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
                  <p>I am the longer in this Section, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I thinke it a very good deed to endevour to comfort poore men who have moſt need thereof. Bleſſed is hee that conſidereth the poor &amp; needy, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. <hi>v.</hi> 2, 3. And indeed there are no men that can enjoy riches more freely, feareleſly and happily, then ſuch as know how to be contented and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in a poore eſtate. This knowledge frees them from all the fears &amp; unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary diſtempers, which many men take about their riches. And mee thinks there are no men more fooliſh (as miſerable) then diſcontented men. And ſo no men more wiſe (as happy) then ſuch as can be contented in all eſtates and conditions.

                  <p>The poore and the rich are in this life equally travellers, both preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to heaven; Now if the rich paſſe through the fairerway, yet they re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in the end a thorne inſtead of every flower which they have paſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; every pleaſure is a griefe in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from; and paſt happineſſe is an irkſome remembrance; ſo that if rich men ſhould laugh for joy in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a thouſands delights, is it not to prepare in their breaſt the matter of as many griefes, ſince every plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is a diſpoſition to a kinde of martyrdome, by the neceſſary and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible privation of it's ſweets, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of while we taſte, it menaceth us? So that in the end, eſpecially at death, rich men ſeeme to be more miſerable then poore men in their greater loſſes. And ſince we muſt all paſſe through the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary privations, loſſes and miſeries of this world, is it not better to ſuffer thoſe evils w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we cannot avoid ſooner then later? The richeſt of the world is at laſt found as poore as the pooreſt
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44773:30"/> companion, and very likely more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable. 'Tis nor to be wondred at, if rich men be more affraid of dangers and of death then poore men, ſince their greater loſſes, and alſo their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed delicacy, makes the ſame to them more dreadfull; whereas many poore men ſeem to embrace death, and rejoyce thereat, as if ſome good Angel were come to free the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life, &amp; carry the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heaven.</p>
                  <p>So as loſſes, croſſes, dangers, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death, are nothing ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to the poore, as to the rich, covetous, ambitious, and voluptuous man; &amp; 'tis like if he can make a good uſe of his poverty, being the more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pious thereby, that heaven will be ſo much the more pleaſant to him eternally, as he was here more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable for a time, a moment in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon; for joy after miſery paſt is the ſweeter.</p>
                  <p>There are yet further meditations come into my mind concerning this bleſſed ſubject. I hope there will bee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44773:30"/> no Reader ſo maligne ſpirited as to envie and grudge the happineſſe of poore men, but rather let us greatly rejoyce thereat. Oh bleſſed be God that giveth ſuch, and ſo much happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to many of thoſe poore people whom the ſtony evill hearted inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rich men of the world doe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, abuſe, ſcorne, contemne and trample upon. A truely good ſoule will deſire and rejoyce to ſee every man good and happy, as wel the poore as the rich.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet, King <hi>David</hi> ſaith, A little that the righteous man hath, is better then great riches of the wicked. Let therefore a poore man be religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, &amp; then though his eſtate be never ſo little, yet is he richer &amp; happier the the richeſt impenitent wicked man in the world. This little is a bleſſing to the righteous, but to a wicked man, riches are but uſurped, and being not uſed well to the glory of God, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ill ends, and in vitious courſes, they do but encreaſe of his miſery and ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>It may be ſaid, that rich men may doe more good then poore men having more meanes; It is true, and bleſſed indeed are thoſe rich men that live well and doe good with their riches. Yet why may not poore men doe as much good, eſpecially to themſelves as the rich. If Chriſt may be judge in this caſe, he ſaith, the poore widdow gave more then all the rich ones, though ſhe gave but two mites out of her poverty, when they gave abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance out of their ſuperfluity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently 'tis like ſhe is more rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in heaven; Yea, even the good will of the poore man and his wiſhes, to doe good with his riches, if he had it, is as acceptable to God as the rich mans almes; For God accepteth the will for the deed when ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the deed is wanting. How much more eaſie is it then for poore men to be charitable, and ſo to lay up for themſelves treaſures in heaven, then rich men, ſince onely his good will is required, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44773:31"/> alſo is requiſite, (as in due and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary collections for the poore, and otherwiſe) which ofttimes comes even as hard and heavily from ſome covetous rich mens purſes, as drops of their blood. And in truth many rich men are ſo farre from doing good with their riches, as they do ofttimes much hurt thereby. They become thereby the more inſolent, diſſolute and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and with their riches they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and maintaine ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And their riches (as hath been ſaid) are to them even as ſnares and baites of wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>To the poore man therefore wee may truely ſay, Hadſt thou beene rich, 'tis like thou wouldſt have beene proud, inſolent, ambitious, covetous, an oppreſſor, or an intemperate, licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, luxurious, idle, miſerable man. Perhaps thy want of riches hath beene an occaſion of thy converſion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of goodneſſe; If ſo, thou art a moſt happy man, thou art infinitely more
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44773:32"/> bleſſed then a wicked impenitent unconverted man, though he be the richeſt, the greateſt Monarch on earth.</p>
                  <p>Poore men, how happy are you, if you bee Gods ſervants? even thoſe eternall riches of the kingdome of heaven belong to you as well as to any other, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.20. Rich men, how miſerable are you, if you be impious and vitious? Then weepe and howle for the miſeries that ſhall come upon you, &amp;c. <hi>Iam</hi> 5.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How is your eſtate worthy of pitty rather then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, if you have no other Paradiſe then your riches? What if you bee the worlds favourites, and ſhe endow you with her choyſeſt treaſures; yet ſince you want grace, your riches ſhall turn but to your greater miſery? Both rich and poore, let us bend our choyſeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes and endevours to gaine this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable Treaſure of divine Grace; without the ſame all other riches are worth nothing; with it even a poore &amp; ſmall eſtate is ſufficient to make a man truely rich contented and happy.

Heaven is an object of conſolation to the pooreſt and moſt miſerable; And certainly the more grace here, the more happineſſe there. And ſince many poore men, ſervants, and others are more gracious and more pious then ſome rich men, they ſhall be alſo crowned with coeleſtiall glory; when the other richer ones ſhal perchance be excluded, or in a leſſe degree glorious. Poore <hi>Lazarus</hi> (though miſerable and deſpiſed on earth) is now in heaven triumphing, enjoying infinite eternall treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Poore men; if you have grace learn then to be ſweetly contented. Doe not murmur at the abundant riches and proſperities of ſome vitious men. Do but conſider as King <hi>David</hi> did, how they periſh and come to a fearefull end, and you will have no cauſe of the leaſt repining envy. Me thinks even in

And ſince you are heires to an heaven of eternall riches and happineſſe; O be you ſweetly contented with this your owne happineſſe, and rather pitty then envy theirs.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf ſeemeth to have an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care of poore men (aſwell as rich) if they be his ſervants. As appeares in divers places of the ſacred Scriptures. As for example, The Lord heareth the poore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.34. Hee is favourable unto them, and preſerveth their ſouls, He will deliver them, and their bloud is deare in his ſight, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 72.12, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hee avengeth and maintaineth their cauſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.12. The Goſpell is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be preached to them, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. They are bleſſed and intituled to the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.20. And in this kingdome, ſurely the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet intendeth, when he ſaith, That God raiſeth up the poore, that he may ſet him with Princes, even with the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44773:33"/> Princes of his people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7, 8. O then deare ſoules, Though you be as poore as ever <hi>Iob</hi> was, yet lift up and ſo lace here your dejected ſpirtts; Here is cauſe enough (if you bee capable thereof) to make you exceeding merry and rejoyce for ever. You ſee that God himſelfe taketh an eſpeciall care of you, and that all his graces and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, all the eternall treaſures and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of heaven, are expoſed to your (aſwell as to the rich mans) aime; That infinite fountain of all riches and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe God himſelfe gives, and offers himſelfe and his heavenly bleſſings to bee poſſeſſed and enjoyed of the pooreſt ſoule, that will by a divine lively faith apply this happineſſe to himſelfe: Inſomueh that you cannot wiſh greater riches or happineſſe then you may enjoy in God, in heavenly Treaſures.</p>
                  <p>Be ye therefore contented, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce even in poverty, and let no man too much feare the loſſe, or grieve for the want of riches, ſince there is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or

                  <p>This diſcourſe of Contentment, I thinke ſo neceſſary as I am yet unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to leave the ſame. My meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons extend themſelves yet further.</p>
                  <p>Why ſhould we feare the loſſe, or grieve too much for the want of riches which are ſo weake and worthleſſe as they cannot ſo much as mitigate the leaſt paine (much leſſe deliver us from death) or by infinite degrees ſatisfie our divine ſoules, which are as farre beyond them, as heaven is above earth. They are even capable to eie, &amp; deſire, infinite and eternall happines, heaven and God himſelfe. But riches are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inſufficient to beſtow upon us true and laſting happineſſe; They have wings and fly away, as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.5. One day ſaw <hi>Iob</hi> the richeſt, and the pooreſt man of all the Eaſt. And millions of men have found the truth of this by experience, that riches are moſt uncertain, undurable. And although it be true that in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44773:34"/> they be ſomething both, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of time and worth, and much to be eſteemed in their good uſe, even as the gifts and bleſſings of God, and from which doth ſpring many good and excellent benefits, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the firſt Section; yet in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the eternall riches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in God himſelfe, they are even as nothing, not to be regarded, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vaine, variable, undurable and fugitive; unconſtant as the moon, brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as the glaſſe, frayle as Ice, momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary as thought, in ſuch compariſon.</p>
                  <p>The poſſeſſors of them are alſo vaine, fading and undurable. The mighty <hi>Craeſſus</hi> (of whom it is ſaid the Mines ſeemed to ſerve for a coffer, the Indies for a cabinet, and the Ocean for a new river of Pactalus) is dead; What is now become of <hi>Cyrus</hi> of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> of rich <hi>Gobrias, Pollicrates, Lucul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe who are regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in the catalogue of rich men, and of their riches? Death hath taken them all away.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44773:35"/>
                  <p>Be contented then, fret not, envy not; and as King <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Bee not afraid when one is made rich, for when he dyes he ſhall carry nothing away, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.16. He is even as vaine, as fraile, as undurable, as his riches.</p>
                  <p>But rather let us lift up our ſoules (ſince the riches of the earth can no way ſatisfie them) to thoſe infinite and eternall riches of heaven, to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. And when our ſouls ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in thoſe divine exhillerations, which do and ſhould often cheere and elevate a Chriſtian heavenly minde. Oh how poorely may we think of ſuch droſſy toyes as are earthly riches in compariſon of theſe heavenly!</p>
                  <p>It is certaine alſo, that no men can take greater pleaſure and felicity even in earthly riches, then ſuch, who are able when they pleaſe to contemne them, even as vanity in compariſon of heavenly treaſures. This divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them puts away all feare of the loſſe of them, all diſtraction about them, and ſo makes us enjoy the ſame
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44773:35"/> more freely. Beſides, it is a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pleaſure to our ſoules to know themſelves ſo high, ſo heavenly, as even when they pleaſe upon good occaſion to contemne the world, in ſuch hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Let me yet goe on further in this happy diſcourſe of Contentment. There is (ſaith King <hi>Solomon</hi>) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himſelfe rich, yet hath nothing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.7. And who is that thinke you? Surely it is the contented pious man.

What remaines then but that we ſeeke theſe true and permanent riches, which are content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and divine graces; whereby wee ſhall poſſeſſe heaven and God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>That ſaying of Philoſophers is moſt true, <hi>That he is moſt rich, who is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented;</hi> and therefore it is ſtrange that

A man that hath but any Art or Science, yea that hath but his hands at will, how can he juſtly complaine of want or poverty, ſince in nature and reaſon, ſo little and ſo few things are neceſſary and ſufficient, thoſe few to bee found almoſt every where in ſuch plenty, as being mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately uſed may ſuffice the condition of every man.</p>

It is a notable folly not to be contented with ſo much as is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and neceſſary.

                  <p>If we have much, yet let us not much regard the ſuperfluity, but in our minds rather ſet it apart for loſſes and croſſes: We may take as much fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in ſufficiency, as if we poſſeſſed all the world; which if we did, we could enjoy the reſt onely by looking on, and contemplation.

If we can doe this, then may we be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the eſtate that God gives us, is beſt for us, whether it be little or much: he was ever ſo carefull of his children, as to give them that which is moſt for their good. Vnworthy men they are who can thinke God will ſuffer ſuch to want that which is good for them, who with a dutiful endeavour do depend on him. Let us truly love, ſerve him, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44773:37"/> and upon my ſoule he will never faile us in what is beſt for us; either he will give us that which we deſire, or better, if not in this life, yet moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in that which is infinitely bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in heaven eternally, yea in both if it be good for us. Let me be ſo dutifull and depend on him, and I have ground enough to be contented and heartily joyfull.. Henceforth then it ſhall be my reſolution to bee contented and ſweetly pleaſed onely with what God pleaſes I ſhall enjoy. Further, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Gods love, care and providence towards his children. Read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34 10.37.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 84.11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 12, 23. And to this purpoſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us. Be content (ſaith he) with ſuch things as ye have: For God hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                  <p>Some men would perſwade us, that it is impoſſible to finde any firme quiet and contentment in this world, without wiſhing or deſiring any other thing or condition then wee now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44773:38"/> whether little or much. But if we will be guided by divine reaſon and wiſedome, what is more eaſie? what impoſſibility can there be to regulate our wils to Gods? What reaſon is there to the contrary, but that wee ſhould even with good grace and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt contentment obey our Soveraigns, our heavenly fathers decrees, and live upon earth onely of the pure gifts and bleſſings of heaven; without wiſhing any other then what he wils and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? If we could truly love and know God, it were impoſſible but we ſhould be infinitely pleaſed with all that hee pleaſes, and with nothing elſe. Oh how rich, how happy are they who are able to undergoe what heaven hath decreed without complaint, without deſiring any other, without arguing or diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting divine providence, ſtill endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to doe the beſt they may, and ſtill being ſweetly contented and pleaſed with what heaven wils.

                  <p>To conclude then, let us therefore above all, rely on the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and truſt him in all things. So may we aſſuredly know that what eſtate ſoever we poſſeſſe, is moſt good, moſt fit for us.

To ſpeake in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly (and my ſoule is very lively toucht with what I ſpeake) every time when I conſider how God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many ineſtimable gratious favours upon me both concerning my body and ſoule. Among very many others, to name onely theſe, That he hath ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44773:40"/> me above the temptations of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, want, and miſery, to which the greateſt part of the world is reduced, and hath given me what I thinke is neceſſary and very largely ſufficient for me, and alſo hath very often chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, elevated, and enriched my ſoul too, with his divine Riches of heavenly joyes, conſolations, and illuminations. Oh, I cannot but ever greatly love his divine goodneſſe, ever bleſſe his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence and loving favours for the ſame; yet confeſſe that I have no way deſerved the leaſt part thereof, but rarher the contrary! The pooreſt, moſt diſconſolate and moſt miſerable man in the world, wherein did I differ from him before time was, when we were both nothing; and yet God hath beſtowed ſuch bleſſings on me rather then on him, whereof to reach the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were to finde the bottomes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercies, to which I muſt remain for ever infinitely obliged. Oh God, that thou wouldſt make me as I deſire (if it might be) infinite thankfull, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44773:40"/> to love thee.</p>
                  <p>Alſo Riches ſhould excite us to, and encourage us in all other duties of piety; That ſince God hath given them to us, we alſo ſhould alſo ſerve him the more freely, willingly, cheerefully and diligently. Let us then by all meanes expreſſe our thankfulneſſe, in our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and willing endeavours to ſerve and pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>And parſicularly, Riches ſhould ſtirre us up to charity towards the poore, the rather ſince God might juſtly have made them rich, and us the pooreſt and moſt miſerable creatures in the world. Oh let us in the midſt of our plenty, remember, pitty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the neceſſities and grievous miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of poore miſerable men, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our abilities and good oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities. God hath the rather given us Riches, that we ſhould doe ſo. Let us take old <hi>Tobits</hi> counſell, who ſaith, Give almes, and turn not thy face from the poore, and then the face of the Lord ſhall not be turned away from
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44773:41"/> thee; If thou haſt much give plenteou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, if thou haſt little, give according to that little, for ſo thou layeſt up for thy ſelfe a good reward, &amp;c. <hi>Tob.</hi> 4.7, 8, 9, 10. Oh ſee what gratious promiſes and encouragements are to this purpoſe! He that hath mercy on the poore, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.21. He ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, 22.9. He ſhall not lacke, 28.27. Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor and needy, the Lord ſhall deliver him in the time of trouble, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.12. God loveth a cheerfull giver, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. With ſuch ſacrifices hee is well pleaſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.6. He that hath pitty on the poore, lendeth unto the Lord, and he will pay him againe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.17.

                  <p>But that which I have chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to diſcourſe of in this Section concerning the divine uſe of Riches is,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44773:41"/> That the ſame may ſtirre us up to ſearch after, and enjoy in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, even on earth, thoſe infinitely more excellent and permanent Riches of God himſelfe, of heaven; The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and felicities of the earth are but reflections from the divine beames of heavenly treaſures and happineſſe, whereby noble ſoules are divinely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and illuminated by the help of theſe ſmall rivolets, to ſearch out that true ſource and fountaine of all happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, God himſelfe, and his heavenly Treaſures, that is, his divine graces and felicities; That treaſure, thoſe bright pearles mentioned, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. which ſhineth out of darkneſſe, and lightneth the earthly veſſels of our hearts, which is the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Ieſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. How divinely doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wiſh to ſee and enjoy theſe Riches; O that the eyes of our underſtanding were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, that we might know what is the Riches of Gods inheritance in the Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. Let therefore theſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44773:42"/> externall treaſures of the earth ſtirre up our ſoules to the deſire and acquiſt of the eternall and heavenly Riches, which are infinitely more excellent, and of which theſe of the earth are but as ſhadowes and little forecaſts.</p>
                  <p>It is the poore mans onely hope to be rich in the world to come, and this hope, if divine and heavenly enough, is ſufficient to poſſeſſe the pooreſt man with Riches farre more worth then all the huge amazements of earthly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The rich man alſo doth, or may with reaſon imagine that if externall, tranſitory, terreſtriall Riches, affoord him ſome happineſſe, he ſhall be much more happy in the enjoying of the eternall and heavenly.</p>
                  <p>Inſomuch that even by reaſon, wee may as it were by theſe earthly, in ſome ſort learne and eſpy thoſe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more excellent Riches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſo as children at firſt by lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a few letters, doe afterwards ſpell, reade, and ſo in time attaine to much knowledge and wiſedome; and then
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44773:42"/> being good ſchollers, they doe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the more excellent things they have learned, even contemne the reading of their A, B, C, and ſpelling bookes, yet ſtill ſcorne not to uſe theſe letters and rudiments of learning, but ſo, as they can be above them, and uſe them as they pleaſe for their owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: So we being at firſt but as children in the knowledge of heavenly things, may yet even by the Riches of the earth in their good uſe and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance learne to ſpel and ſpye therefrom in ſome meaſure the Riches of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And ſo having from theſe tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and earthly felicities, learned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heavenly happineſſe, we may be able to be above, and even to deſpiſe theſe earthly in compariſon of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſures which are infinitely more excellent; yet ſo, as that without ſuch compariſon, and in reſpect of their Authour, of our nature and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and of their good uſe, we ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And they are ſo much more excellent, as that all the Riches in the world are not comparable to the leaſt degree of divine grace, ſince by the price thereof we may buy the eternall Riches of God himſelfe: The Lord is rich unto all that call upon him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.12. And theſe Riches are indeed infinitely beyond mans weake expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or ſhallow earthly apprehenſion. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe it ſeems could not finde words to expreſſe theſe Riches, nor ſearch the depth of them, which made him to ſay, <hi>O the depth of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God. Rom.</hi> 11.33. and to cal them the unſearchable Riches of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.8. alſo the exceeding Riches of his grace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p>In deſiring theſe Riches, we cannot be too covetous; Covet earneſtly the beſt gifts ſaith Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> O let our deſires and our deſignes be eager in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44773:43"/> the purſuite of theſe heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. And let the Riches of the earth help to direct, encourage and incite us to the acquiſt of thoſe divine Riches.</p>
                  <p>What though the blinde buzzards of the world dote onely upon earthly Riches, and cannot ſee theſe infinitely more excellent heavenly Treaſures? yet Gods Saints (the eyes of whoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding are enlightned, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18.) do very perſpicuouſly and gloriouſly view them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6, 7. And thogh we uſe theſe earthly felicities as paſſage-boats and ſhips, the better to carry us to the haven where we ſhould be, to that cape of good hope, to thoſe happy Iſlands, the heavenly Canaan, yet doe we not ſet our hearts ſo on theſe ſhips or boats, as to neglect or forget our heavenly haven, but rather ſo, as the better and oftner to remember the ſame, and to convey us thither. And we can with a moſt willing minde, when God pleaſes leave thoſe ſhips (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did his) to arrive at this our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly countrey.

                  <p>And we may truly ſay, That ſuch men as terminate their hopes, deſires and affections, to poſſeſſe thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall heavenly treaſures (which are only able to quench the thirſt of our ſouls) are the richeſt in the world. Whence it is that a truly pious man can in compariſon of theſe divine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, when he pleaſes, trample under foot very generouſly all the treaſures and Riches of the earth, through the knowledge of thoſe which his ſpirit poſſeſſeth, while he contemplates the eternall glorious Riches of heaven.</p>
                  <p>How rich is he, O Lord, who is thus heavenly minded, enough to contemne
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44773:44"/> worldly in compariſon of divine trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and to enjoy earthly Riches on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in thee, and to thy glory. How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented is he who thinks and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates often of eternall Riches. Oh, how happy is he that makes thy ſelfe his treaſures. O God, let it ever be the choiſeſt deſires of my ſoule to be ſo rich, ſo contented, ſo happy.

                  <p>Honour is defined by ſome to bee the rumour of a beautifull and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous action, which reboundeth from our ſelves to the view of the world; and by reflection into our ſelves, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

It may be called a gracefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or renowned reputation, which every man ought to have in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of his worthineſſe, declared unto the world by good and glorious deeds, and approved by the acknowledgment of good and vertuous men.

The opinion of men is much too weake a recompence for vertue, and not to be compared with the inward delight of the ſoule; And vertue deſireth not a more ample or rich Theatre to ſhew her ſelfe and her actions, then her owne ſoule and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; The teſtimony thereof ſhee eſteemes much better then of all the world beſides; yet with modeſty, in all good waies ſhe diſdaineth not (but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther endeavoureth and rejoyceth to gaine) this outward honour alſo.

                  <p>True honor and good eſtimation, is the moſt illuſtrious, moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moſt durable good that a man hath in this world, foraſmuch as he leaveth unto the world a good teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his life, and to his own poſterity a good example.</p>
                  <p>Honour alſo may ſerve to many good uſes, as to countenance and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold all goodneſſe and good men, to ſtirre and inflame us to all good, pious, and laudable actions, and thereby to looke to that fountaine of all honour and glory, God himſelfe, and thoſe coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall rayes of glory; of which theſe terreſtriall are but little reflections, thoſe eternall crownes and kingdomes of heaven.

                  <p>However vertuous, pious, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy actions give true pleaſure to the conſcience, and makes us honourable and illuſtrious in the ſight of good men, and moſt certainly (however the maligne ſpirits of the world may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) of Angels, yea and of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid that ſuch as are of royall and noble births, and in places of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt dignity, majeſtracy and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, either in Church or common wealth, ought to demeane themſelves moſt worthily and nobly; for vertuous, pious and worthy actions, are legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate parents of true honour, without which it can no more be, then a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow without a body; for otherwiſe it is only as a ſhadow of honour, and a bubble of vaine glory; nor can ſuch falſe and vitious honour be any true pleaſure to the conſcience of ſuch men, but rather ought to be a grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, knowing that themſelves are foule and darkeſome within, however they may paint themſelves with the gay outſide of oſtentation and hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie. And no wiſe man will bow to a molten calfe, though made of gold;

Or if the body doe bow to ſuch a vitious unworthy man, the minde tels it, that it honours an unworthy ſubject, and even then while the body bowes, the minde contemnes him. Nor doth vice and wickedneſſe ſhew more deformed in any men, then in ſuch as degenerate from their high birth and authority, ſince their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe drawes more eyes to behold their vices, and therefore commonly they leave a more infamous and rotten name behind them to poſterity. And if we peruſe all hiſtories, wee ſhall finde that ſuch as have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to vitious courſes, are alwaies regiſtred as infamous for their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy governing in their places of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

                  <p>There are alſo divers kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of true honour, which are to be attained unto by vertue in our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and generall vocations.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, in reſpect of a mans ſelfe: For he that poſſeſſeth vertue, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth lawes unto himſelfe, and thereby endeavoureth to conquer his unruly and moderate paſſions and affections (whereby he becommeth Lord of his owne Dominions) and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a perfect man by the exerciſe of good and vertuous actions. Without this no man can be ſaid to be truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable: For what greater ſervitude and baſeneſſe, then to be in a ſlaviſh ſubjection to our owne diſordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and affections: And what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent honour is it (ſuch as God and Angels approve of) to ſee a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and be commander of himſelfe? This is the ground of all true Honour.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:44773:50"/>
                  <p>The ſecond is in reſpect of a family; When a man hath once gotten a habit of vertue, and ſo knoweth how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne himſelfe, he ſhall eaſily be able alſo to governe and inſtruct a family. No man liveth more unworthily then he that liveth meerely for himſelf. But he that imployeth his endeavours for the good of his family, friends, kindred and neighbours, in good and laudable wayes, liveth well, worthily and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.</p>
                  <p>The third is, in reſpect of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth. There is great affinity between a politicall and oeconimicall body; inſomuch as ſome Polititians ſay, they differ only in magnitude and proportion of buſineſſe, and have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame period: So that hee who well knoweth how to govern himſelfe and a family, may by diligence, ſtudy, wiſedome, and uſuall converſation in the affaires of State, in the lawes and cuſtomes of the countrey, be able to governe a common wealth, or at leaſt with no great difficulty to execute and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44773:51"/> performe the duties of his office, place and dignity therein, in a laudable and ſo honourable manner. Neither indeed ought we to give greater honour to any men, then to ſuch as imploy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the generall good of the Church and common wealth.</p>
                  <p>And it is certaine, that ſuch as are truly honourable and generous ſpirits, doe feele themſelves lively toucht in ſoule with an earneſt deſire of doing good unto thoſe with whom they live, ſo that herein they are not daunted with the greatneſſe of paine, or feare of perill.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore learne to demeane our ſelves worthily and laudably in our places and callings, whatſoever they be, as well particular as generall: For although the greateſt honour is due to ſuch as doe acquite themſelves of great high places of authority, in Church and common wealth; yet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, according to each mans degree and deſert, is generally due to thoſe perſons that doe well performe their
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44773:51"/> duty in their profeſſions, and vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both generall of Chriſtianity, and publique good, and alſo particular, whatſoever the ſame be.</p>
                  <p>And ſince alſo he is to be eſteemed truly honourable, who doth well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne himſelfe in the wayes of vertue and piety, and therein doth worthily; (for true honour only conſiſts in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and pious actions) Let us ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to apply our ſelves to the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition both of morall and divine pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, fortitude, and all the moſt noble vertues and graces; to ſcorne and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all unworthy and baſe actions; and on the contrary, to addict our ſelves to the acquiſition of good and excellent (though difficult) things, to be reſolute therein, and couragious; to ſtand upon our owne bottomes in all good ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pious wayes, and not to be led away with flatteries and idle opinions, nor with the diſcouragements or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reproaches of baſe, vitious, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute people; to imitate as farre as wee may, the beſt men in their moſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44773:52"/> ſublime and excellent actions.</p>
                  <p>But we are ſtill to obſerve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this caution, that wee ſhould not onely be vertuous, pious, and doe good onely for outward honour and glory, as if that were the ſolary and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thereof; the opinion of men is farre to weake a pay for divine vertue and grace. And as the ſame is too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, ſo alſo too noble to beg ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence. We ſhould perſwade our ſelves that vertue and divine grace (were it not to doe good to others) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not, nor ſeeketh a more ample and rich Theatre, to ſhew it ſelfe then her owne ſoule and conſcience, no other recompence then the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and pleaſures thereof in its own witneſſe of well doing, which is farre better then the teſtimony of all the world beſides. Therefore a truly vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pious man (who is truly an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2.) ſcornes to look for only outward rewards; he holds it for a Principle, a Maxime, that the fruit of honourable actions is to have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44773:52"/> acted them, yea to have endeavoured them. Wherein he taketh moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing delight, and if any outward honor, as the good opinion of men, and ſo a good name bee added to this inward delight of his ſoule, he alſo modeſtly rejoyces, and well eſteemes thereof, yet but as an uncertaine, fraile (though good) bleſſing, and not to be compared with the inward teſtimony and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of his conſcience, in well doing. Yet he endeavoureth in all good wayes with modeſty to gaine this outward honour alſo, a good name, and the good opinion of men; for vertue not onely adorneth a man with true wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, modeſty, and a pleaſing conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but alſo accompanieth him with valour and magnanimity takes away from him all baſe feare of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and of death, and inciteth every one that is endued with a generous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition, to erect unto himſelfe an eternall remembrance, by vertuous, glorious, and ſo honourable actions.</p>
                  <p>To proceed more particularly. This
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44773:53"/> crown of honour alſo duely belongeth unto two ſorts of men; that is, firſt, to ſuch as profeſſe learning. Secondly, to ſuch as profeſſe Armes or martiall affaires. Foraſmuch as the endeavours of the valiant Generall, Captaine, and ſouldiers, ſeemes to aime almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at honour and the renowne of men: I ſhall firſt, in this reſpect diſcourſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Honour is moſt juſtly due unto thoſe men, who ſpend their lives in the ſervice of their Prince and countrey, and voluntarily oppoſe themſelves to apparant dangers for the preſervation of the common wealth from forreine invaſions; and to maintaine our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, our Lawes, and liberty, which next under God are the neceſſary cauſe of our well being. Since they take ſuch great paines in ſo many and great dangers, for ſuch high and worthy ends, this crown of honour therefore in this reſpect moſt worthily appertained to ſuch men; neither ſhineth it ſo magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently and gloriouſly in any affaires,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44773:53"/> as in the couragious attempts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall enterprizes.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is that the golden Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant (although he be a very profitable and worthy member of the common-wealth) yet ſo much honoured as the poore ſouldier, for the one heapeth up a mountaine of treaſure, reſpecting chiefly his owne enriching; the other practiſeth but few meanes to enrich himſelfe, and thoſe alſo as inſtruments of honour; the principall end of all his endeavours being referred to the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of our Religion and liberty, to the good of our countrey, to the faithfull ſervice of our King, and to the acquiſition of honour and glory.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore in antient times, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable rewards of ſuch men, have been given crownes, lawrels, garlands, ſtatues, a certaine forme of accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the honour of ſome ſirname, orders of knighthood, places of worth and dignity, precedency in aſſemblies, penſions of money, and the like, have been worthily beſtowed upon ſuch as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44773:54"/> have valiantly fought for their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Prince, and countrey; and Armes have been permitted to noble perſonages, as the recogniſance of their honour. But it falleth out ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that ſome of theſe and the like markes of honour, to ſuch as have not deſerved the ſame, are an occaſion of their greater diſgrace; for high titles and great authority without vertue and publique utility, are deſervedly contemptible: And alſo ſometimes it may be greater honour not to have theſe honourable marks, having deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them then to have them: It is more honourable unto me (ſaid <hi>Cato</hi>) that every man ſhould aske me why I have not a ſtatue erected in the market place, then why I have it. Theſe mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary martiall affaires therefore do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre on men ſuch deſerved honour, as crowneth them with a ſhining light, reflecting a ſplendent brigtneſſe to poſterity. Inſomuch as divers famous Philoſophers and Hiſtoriographers, as <hi>Socrates, Xenophon, Architas, Thucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dides,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44773:54"/> Thales, Epiminondas,</hi> and a milli-of other famous men have offered themſelves to all perils to gaine honor and glory, and for the benefit and ſafety of their common wealth. Yea, inſomuch as many Emperours, Kings, and Princes have eſteemed, and doe eſteeme it a great addition to their honour to maintaine, and to be marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defendors (if occaſion be) of their Religion and countrey.</p>
                  <p>This crowne of honour alſo moſt deſervingly belongeth unto them which profeſſe learning, eſpecially thoſe moſt honourable, ſublime, and generous profeſſions of Divinity, Law and Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>Divinity (which concernes princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally that moſt excellent part of man, the eternall heavenly ſoule; and the profeſſors thereof being converſant in the knowledge of God and his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the ſcience of living well and bleſſedly for ever, and ſo in all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, divine and eternall things) is moſt honourable and moſt worthy the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44773:55"/> ſtudy and knowledge of the greateſt Monarch on earth. Nor can there be a greater addition to the honour of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings, and Princes, then to be religious and worthy defendors of the true Chriſtian faith.</p>
                  <p>The law alſo is a generous and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable profeſſion (however it be abuſed, and although there be many unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſharking and unconſcionable Lawyers, of whom let us beware) the good uſe and intent thereof is moſt honourable and excellent; As for the preſervation of mens perſons from death and violence, their good names from reproach, ſlander, and infamy; alſo their goods and lands from waſte and ſpoile, and to diſpoſe the property thereof. And in generall, for the good and proſperity of the weale publique, and maintenance of all vertue and true Religion. Inſomuch as many Kings and Princes have thought it their greateſt honor to be well skilled herein, to make and eſtabliſh good and profitable Lawes and Decrees; as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44773:55"/> 
                     <hi>Numa, Trajan, Antonius Pius, Severus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian, Lycurgus,</hi> and many others.</p>
                  <p>Phiſicke alſo is an honourable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (however there be many igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unlearned Emperickes in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Townes, which makes this noble and profitable ſcience to be evill ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by ſome) yet ſchollers doe well know the Theory of Phiſicke is a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious field of knowledge, requiring in the learned profeſſor, the Latine and Greeke tongues eſpecially; and to be well skilled in philoſophy and hiſtory, eſpecially naturall, to know the whole ſtructure and frame of the body of man, the operation of all vegetatives and minerals, both ſimples and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, and ſo to enquire into the moſt ſecret and obſtruſeſt cloſets of nature; alſo skill in Aſtronomy, Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, and ſo much of the juditials upon all manner of Calculations as may be well warranted and not ſuperſtitiouſly affected; with much other kinde of art and learning. Divers Kings, as <hi>Orſiris</hi> and <hi>Zeſoſtris,</hi> Kings of Aegypt, <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:44773:56"/> King of Pontus, <hi>Evax</hi> King of Arabia, and others have written tracts of this ſubject of Phyſicke; and <hi>Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius</hi> for his skill herein was eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a god.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this Section; although it be true that few men are capable to attaine the top of honour, yet wee ought not to be diſcouraged, but to make more account of that little which we can attaine unto (eſpecially by living well and honeſtly in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vocation, and alſo particular, whatſoever the ſame be) then of all the reſt of our wealth. For why, even the mighty ſtateſman is in ſome reſpects beholding to the husbandman, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, ſea-man, all arts-men, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanickes; ſo as he cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, like as they cannot ſubſiſt without the ſtateſman; God being pleaſed herein to ſhew his good provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſo uniting each man to other in an indiſſoluble knot of neceſſity, and accepting of every mans good and vertuous endeavours aſwell in ſmall
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44773:57"/> matters as in great; for true honour onely conſiſts in vertuous and pious actions, which doe ſhine forth moſt brightly in the ſight of good men, yea to the view, approbation, and delight of Angels, and of God himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11, 13, 15, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.24. And though by vitious men even theſe vertuous and gracious actions may be reproach't and diſeſteemed in this life, yet ſhall the ſame be crownes of honor and glory to us in the heavenly life eternally, when wee ſhall ſhine as the firmament the ſtars, &amp; the ſun for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.41, 42. yea in ſome ſort even as the glorious body of Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2.</p>
                  <p>So then let us endeavour to attaine this true honour or good eſtimation, which is gained by vertuous, pious, profitable and worthy actions, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſince the ſame appeares to be the moſt illuſtrious, moſt commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and moſt durable good, that a man
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44773:58"/> can poſſeſſe, foraſmuch as he leaveth a good example to poſterity, a good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his life to the world, and is crowned thereby with everlaſting ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory in the heavens.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et us conſider, that we are by all meanes to eſchew the abuſes and dangers of honour, which otherwiſe will hinder our happineſſe therein, and bring upon us miſchiefe and miſery.</p>
                  <p>Many men while fortune ſmiles (as they ſay) abuſe their honour and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to the maintenance of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in, and to the ſupport of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute &amp; wicked courſes, priviledging themſelves therein by their greatneſſe they grow proud, ſtout, arrogant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44773:58"/> forget God and goodneſſe, and plunge themſelves into all licentious and voluptuous courſes (of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries whereof I ſhall write God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their due places) And at the laſt perhaps loſe their honour, and leave a rotten ſtinking name and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory behind them. However, if men uſe (or rather abuſe) their honour to vitious diſſolute wicked courſes, the ſame will turne to their greater perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It had been better for ſuch men to have endured deſpicable ſhame, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, and ignominy. Theſe dangers and abuſes of honour, therefore, are by all means to be avoided.</p>
                  <p>A further danger of honour hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring happineſſe, and cauſing miſery, is that common vice of many great men, namely, Ambition. But firſt obſerve this caution, That in this enſuing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe againſt Ambition. I doe not intend to ſpeak againſt that honeſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, or deſire of honour which ſtirs us up to vertuous, gracious (and therin worthy and honourable) actions. I
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44773:59"/> thinke it good that we looke up to the examples of thoſe men who are moſt worthy and vertuous, that we may out of an honeſt emulation and deſire, mend our ſelves by continuall ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to imitate their vertues and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, and ſo to doe worthily in all good and laudable actions for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, aſwell of Gods Church and the common wealth, as of our families and ſelves. But now to define what I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in this Section by Ambition. It is a vice of exceſſe, and contrary to modeſty, which is a part of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; namely, it is an exceſſive deſire of outward honour. It is commonly an unſatiable deſire, and compoſed with pride, vaine glory, inſolency, and the like. It is the moſt haughty vice of all others, and ſeated in the very ſoule it ſelfe, and therefore moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>Before we view the evill and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects thereof, a few words concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the extent. Men eſpying a bright luſtre and excellency in honour; they
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44773:59"/> are prone to runne thereafter without the bound-markes of reaſon, and ſo plunge themſelves into this boundles and top-leſſe vice of Ambition.</p>
                  <p>The gay and glorious outſide of this Glow-worme, vaine-glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with outward pompe, pride, hipocriſie, vanity, and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo bewitcheth the world to ſeeke thereafter, as they are even mad to gaine the ſame, and endeavour by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency, flattery, bribery, or any other baſeneſſe to attain their deſires. It is ſtrange to thinke how ſome men will even ſigh after this falſe outſide of honour, with deſignes to hazzard life and ſoule for the conqueſt of theſe vaine felicities. Inſomuch as many men in our times ſeeme to be of the ſame minde with thoſe chiefe Rulers mentioned, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.42. who loved the praiſe of men more then the praiſe of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p>But let us now briefly view the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, evils, dangers, and miſeries of this vice of Ambition.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:44773:60"/>
                  <p>What folly and vanity is it which makes men (as many doe) take ſuch paines even with all vitious meanes, as flattery, bribery, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and the like, to gaine that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward honour, which without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teſtimony of a good conſcience, is but as ſmoke, a vapour, aire, breath, opinion, wherein he loſeth his owne liberty to follow the paſſions and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of other men.</p>
                  <p>Ambitious thoughts make a man cleane forget what he ought to be, and abandon all actions of duty, tranſports him beyond equity and reaſon, and commonly brings him to a great and miſerable downefall. From this perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious root of Ambition, ſpringeth abundance of evils to the ſoule of man, for he that is wholly infected with this vice becommeth proud, ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, inſolent, faithleſſe, diſhoneſt, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, mutinous, an oppreſſour, an Atheiſt, a traitor, a contentious and ſeditious perſon. Ambition hath been the cauſe of divers murders, warres,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44773:60"/> and ruine of Empires, Kingdomes, Cities, and a multitude of families and perſons. <hi>Alexanders</hi> ambition was the decay of the Eaſterne world, and <hi>Iulius Caeſars</hi> of the moſt flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing common wealth then being.</p>
                  <p>Ambition often trampleth and contemneth even Religion it ſelfe: It will make <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Mahomet</hi> to tollerate any Religion ſo they may raigne. Thoſe Arch-heretickes and Schiſmatickes of the world, what was it but Ambition that puffed them up to be chiefe leaders, though in errours and lies. What was it but ambition that ſtirred up, and continued the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of ſupremacy betweene the Churches of Ieruſalem, Antioch, Conſtantinople, and Rome, the ſpace of almoſt 300. yeares, untill at laſt <hi>Phocas</hi> adjudged the ſupremacy to the Biſhop of Rome, which brought forth horrible tumults, deadly hatred, and ſhamefull ſchiſmes among the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And ſince the ambition of divers Popes, when ſometimes two or three
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44773:61"/> have raigned together, hath cauſed the bloudſhedding and ruine of many Chriſtians. Alſo how much bloud was ſhed by reaſon of thoſe ambitious diviſions of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> of <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> of <hi>Cneus Pompeius,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> in Rome. Of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Orleance and Burgundy in France. Of Yorke and Lancaſter in England. How many ambitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits have done hatefull murders, that they might rule and raigne alone, as <hi>Abimilech, Athalia, Ioram, Zimri, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus, Dionyſius, Buſiris, Periander, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miramis</hi> Queene of Naples, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Antonius</hi> Emperours, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>froy,</hi> and <hi>Irene</hi> mother to the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine, Richard</hi> the third of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and many others, <hi>Baſsianus</hi> the Turke; alſo <hi>Selimus,</hi> who killed <hi>Corun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his younger brother, and five of his Nephewes, <hi>Solyman</hi> who murdered his owne ſonne the valiant <hi>Muſtapha, Adrian</hi> the Emperour many of his Emulators, <hi>Maximinus</hi> all his Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, <hi>Herod</hi> of Iury all the Synedrim
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44773:61"/> and bloud-royall of the Iewes, with many others whom I might recount. Ambition was the ruine and perdition even of the Angels themſelves.</p>
                  <p>From this ambitious and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire, ſpringeth a multitude of vaine purpoſes, plots, cares, jealouſies, envies, feares, griefes, and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
                  <p>Ambitious men thinke ſtill their owne condition not good enough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others are better, and pine with envy at the honour and proſperity of their neighbours. It is a greater griefe to an ambitious man to ſuffer one to goe beyond him, then it is pleaſure to leave a thouſand behind him. Hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes not ſo much the honour he hath, as pines with envy, deſire, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of what he hath not, and what others have. Thus <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> is ſaid to be more fretted at the glory of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> then joyous of his owne; and <hi>Ariſtides</hi> at his emulated corrivals, then at all the honours hee receives from the Athenians.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:44773:62"/>
                  <p>An ambitious man grieves, and is exceeding angry, if others neglect him, and thinke him not ſo good as he thinks himſelfe. If <hi>Haman</hi> be not bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto by <hi>Mordecai,</hi> he is ful of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and griefe.</p>
                  <p>The remembrance of any diſgrace or injury paſt, doth often much grieve ambitious men, and feares of that which may come perplexes them. And if they be once croſſed in their ambitious deſires, and in ſtead of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, fall, they become exceeding ſad &amp; melancholy; inſomuch as many ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men, after ſuch loſſe of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or croſſe in their ambition, have ſeemed even to ſcorne the world, and mankinde, been ready to turne here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, traitors, and deſperately to ſpend their dayes, and ſo end them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe immoderate deſires, cares, feares, &amp; griefs do often cauſe the body to pine &amp; wither, increaſe melancholy, ſhorten life. By this aſpiring vice of ambition, many millions of men have wrought their owne overthrow.

                     <hi>Baaſha, Zimri, Shallum,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> kings of Iſrael, <hi>Abſolom,</hi> proud <hi>Iezabel, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable examples of the miſerable downefall of pride and ambition. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories make mention of thirty ſeven Emperours of Rome, within the ſpace of 100 yeares, onely three of them died of ſickneſſe in their beds. The reſt came to untimely ends. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples alſo of <hi>Pharaoh, Adonizebeck, Agag,</hi> of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and the Kings of Aſia who drew that once Scythians ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards coach, alſo <hi>Valerian, Mauritius, Richard</hi> the ſecond of England, <hi>Francis</hi> King of France impriſoned by <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of Normandy, and divers others in all ages; yea the death and ruine of all the Emperours, Kings, Princes, and famous men that ever were in the world, who are now all buried in earth, and rotten in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, doe ſhew ſufficiently the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, uncertainty, and frailty of that honour and greatneſſe, which ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men ſo unſatiably deſire and ſeeke
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44773:63"/> after. Inſomuch as the grave and wormes have conquered and devoured the greateſt conquerors, princes, and renowned men.</p>
                  <p>And as if honour and ambition did but the ſooner haſten men to this ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and deſtruction, with what vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence doe many great men runne into this vice of ambition, till they breake their owne neckes. They riſe but to fall; as did <hi>Iulius Caeſar, Pompey, Hani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, Marcus, Craſſus, Marius, Spurius Melius, Sejanus, Byron, Nicias, Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus, Cumenes, Xerxes, Pyrrhus,</hi> and a million of others, both antient and moderne.</p>
                  <p>Though ambitious men ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſome height of their ambitious deſires, yea commence even the higheſt degrees of vaine glory, yet would they not be contented; they would ſtill be ambitious, and wiſh (like <hi>Alexander</hi>) that there were more worlds for them to rule and domineere over.</p>
                  <p>Although ambition be commonly noted to be ſeated onely in generous,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44773:63"/> noble and great ſpirits, yet there are ſome meane men of low degree that are toucht with this vice of ambition; there are ſome beggers that would very fain be men of office and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though it were but to be revenged of the Conſtable, and put him alſo in the ſtockes. Some Mechanickes would faine grow to be Gentlemen, and riſe higher, according to that old Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Geta</hi> from wooll and weaving firſt began,</l>
                        <l>Swelling and ſwelling to a Gentleman.</l>
                        <l>Fortune ſtill ſmiling on this doughty wight,</l>
                        <l>He left not ſwelling till he was a Knight:</l>
                        <l>And ſo forgetting what he was at firſt,</l>
                        <l>He ſwel'd to be a Lord, and then he burſt.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So ambitious men are never ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with riſing till they fall to the grave; they will ever be ſwelling like the frog in the fable, though it be till they burſt. An ambitious Gentleman would very faine be a Knight; a Knight a Lord, and ſo a Count, a Duke, a King, an Emperour, and then
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44773:64"/> of more larger, richer, and better do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, kingdomes, empires, worlds, &amp;c. But they ſhall fall as low as death. Nor doth honour at all ſatisfie their ambition, but rather increaſe the ſame. If perchance they attaine to ſome high degree thereof, yet they deſire, care, feare, plot, grieve, envy, pine, and ſo ſtill perplexe themſelves. So that it is an unſatiable deſire, even as a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomeleſſe gulfe, and therefore unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall: For the Philoſophers ſay, there is no vacuity in nature; but this deſire is ever empty, never ſatisfied. Honour it ſelfe doth but ſerve as more fuell to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the fire thereof. The motions of an ambitious mans deſire are as <hi>Ixions</hi> wheele, ever turning and returning, never giving reſt, but alwaies vexing and troubling the mind. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent can he have who is haunted with ſuch a hag as ambition. It appeares therefore, that an ambitious man is ſeldome contented, often vexed, never ſatisfied. If he attaine to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Monarch on earth, he is vexed at
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44773:64"/> mortality, and grieves becauſe he is not a God. The Angels themſelves who fell, are thought to be thus ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, who aſpiring to be as Gods, were therefore throwne downe to the depth of hell. And ſince perſwading our firſt parents alſo to be immortall, and as gods on earth, though they kept not Gods command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>They who doe ambitiouſly dote af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honour, thinke perchance the ſame will prove rocks of defence in all exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, when indeed they are like to find one day the ſame to be but caſtles in the aire: They imagine perchance like the Nimrodian builders, that they ſhall thereby eternize their names, and ſo climbe up to heaven; but in truth they are like to fall to the loweſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of ruine: for the higher ambitious men riſe, the greater is their downfall and ruine. When ſickneſſe and death
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44773:65"/> appeares, it is unſpeakable how they grieve to ſee themſelves ready to bee throwne downe to the grave, and their honour to lye in the duſt. So is all their glory buried in ruine.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes God himſelfe hateth and reſiſteth haughty, ambitious, proud men, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 16.5. <hi>Iames</hi> 4.6. and will conſume them as ſtubble, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1.</p>
                  <p>Let us then, if we will be happy in reſpect of honour, take heed that this boundleſſe, perilous, unſatiable, and miſerable vice of ambition doe not poſſeſſe us.

And alſo let us endeavour to uſe honour well, and ſo we may freely and divinely enjoy it (of this in the fifth Section.) But now alſo that we may be farther, and more freely happy therein, Let us endeavour to ſettle our minds in ſuch an habit of contentedneſſe, as that wee doe not too much feare the loſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or grieve for the want thereof.</p>
                  <p>Let us leave the ſucceſſe of all our
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44773:66"/> good endeavours to God, relying on, and truſting him in all things. So may we be truly perſwaded that all things ſhall convert to our good, That what honor or good repute ſoever we have, the ſame is moſt good, moſt fit for us; yea, then we need not feare the loſſe or want thereof, but may be truly conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and rejoyce even in reproach, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhonour, and ſhame; which that wee may, let us further conſider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve.</p>
                  <p>And firſt concerning reproach, ſlander, and detraction. Wee may not thinke to live in this world without evill words and reproaches, eſpecially of diſſolute maligne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But let us endeavour with a manly courage, to contemne and tread under foot the follies, the childiſh braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and curriſh carping of ſuch men, as we would the barking of a dog. Hee, whoſe ſoule is truly innocent, wiſe, and magnanimous, ſmileth at, and contemneth the reproaches of fooliſh, braineſicke, diſſolute, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44773:66"/> people. As for ſuch as are truly good and vertuous, they will not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly reproach or wrong any man: and for the other, their ill cenſures are not worth regarding, but rather to be contemned, yea, we may rejoyce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at. It is a good ſigne, happy are we if we be reproached for goodneſſe, wee may then rejoyce with glorious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly joy. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſo adviſeth and telleth us: Rejoyce (ſaith he) inaſmuch as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, that when his glory ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, ye may be glad with exceeding joy. If ye be reproached for the name of Chriſt (ſo for any goodneſſe, any pious Chriſtian actions) happy are ye for the ſpirit of glory, and of God reſteth upon you, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13, 14. Let us then when ſuch vitious men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach us, endeavour to be the better, the more happy and joyfull.</p>
                  <p>Let us endeavour to pleaſe God, and if we can, good men alſo, and then it matters not to pleaſe others. To have every man ſpeake well of us is
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44773:67"/> impoſſible, becauſe however wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane our ſelves, ſome Cynicke will barke at our wayes and actions; A man muſt live as in a cell, be fooliſhly idle, obſcure, and weakly neglect to doe all (though good) open actions, or elſe he cannot eſcape the laſh of cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, detractive, reproachfull, vitious, maligne ſpirits. If we ſhould be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, profuſe, and diſſolute, wee ſhould pleaſe (perchance) ſuch as are ſo, but not God nor good men. And if we live vertuouſly and piouſly, the world will hate us as ſeparatiſts from the folly and vices thereof, and then our repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations will ſurely be traduced by the ignominious aſperſions of malevolent tongues; for to be good is by many (yet onely by fooles, and thoſe whom King <hi>Solomon</hi> notes for the worſt and moſt fooles, namely, wicked men) thought contemptible: But indeed he is wiſer that pleaſes one good, then a thouſand bad men. And he is the beſt and wiſeſt that pleaſeth God. And ſince God accepts of good wils and endeavours
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44773:67"/> for deeds; happy is he that endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to pleaſe him.</p>
                  <p>Let me here (if it be ſo) make a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Since in writing and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing this book, I have endevoured and hoped to pleaſe God &amp; vertuous pious men, and ſince I have been very much encouraged herein by ſome, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be reproached and reviled by malignant tongues, rather then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to doe that good which I hope the publiſhing hereof will doe, rather then hurt; for I expect to be reproched and abuſed by ſome ſuch kind of men for writing and publiſhing this (thogh it tend principally to happineſſe even on earth) eſpecially I expect the ſame from ſome who perchance (though in a generall way) will finde themſelves toucht in this Tractate; namely, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, idle, careleſſe, prodigall people, and alſo covetous men; likewiſe, low, baſe, unworthy minded men, and alſo ambitious ſpirits (of theſe I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten formerly, the reſt follow) alſo too rugged, overnice <hi>Tymons,</hi> Diſdainers
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44773:68"/> of women and marriage, you may call them Love-haters; alſo doting, effoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, ſottiſh, phantaſticke, adle-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lovers; and likewiſe whoremaſters. Further, gluttons, gurmundizers, alſo tipling blades, roaring boyes, &amp; all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate vitious perſons. Alſo meere carnall, ſenſuall fooles, ſuch as neither know nor perceive thoſe divine Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Honours, and delights of heaven (of which in the laſt Sections of each partition is diſcourſed.) But eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I expect to be reproacht by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, barking, curriſh, rugged, maligne diſcontented ſpirits; ſuch as envy, pine, and grudge at all happy pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, eſpecially at all pleaſing (though harmeleſſe and profitable) books, ſuch as aime at delight and happineſſe. But to ſay what I thinke, that ſuch men are the moſt fooles (as well as miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) who do wilfully live moſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, ſullen, envious, malitious, and ſorrowfull; and that ſuch are very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the beſt and wiſeſt (aſwell as happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt) who doe live moſt contentedly, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44773:68"/> and joyfully even on earth. That this is plainely true, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſhew in thoſe three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treatiſes, which I have written concerning this ſubject, Happineſſe on earth. And of which I intend to publiſh more hereafter, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a better, more profitable or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſubject, to ſtudy, thinke, or write of. But whither do I wander; To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. Since I have endeavoured in this booke to pleaſe God and good men, I will not care what others thinke or ſay thereof. And if I did not thinke the publiſhing of this Treatiſe would doe good rather then hurt (and the rather I thinke ſo ſince I find ſo much good to my ſelfe in writing thereof) and alſo if I had not beene very much encouraged herein by ſome who have read a former Coppy hereof, whoſe Judgements and ſincerity I cannot but with very good reaſon truſt and think worthily of, I ſhould not otherwiſe have preſumed to publiſh the ſame; But ſince therefore I think and hope
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44773:69"/> the ſame will doe good, I dare not, I will not hinder or neglect the ſame, though I were ſure that all the maligne ſpirited men in the world would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, detract from, and abuſe the ſame and me, as much as poſſibly they could.</p>
                  <p>I know it is very eaſie (for ſuch as will be malitious) to cenſure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict even goodneſſe &amp; truth it ſelf; for truth is but one, &amp; ſeeming truths are many: and few works are perform'd without ſome errors, at leaſt ſeeming ones in ſome mens judgements, whoſe opinions are as various as falſe. No man can write a leafe, but malice and opinion (being diſpoſed to cavill) may carp thereat. The cleaneſt corne will not be without ſome touch of ſoile, no not after often winnowing; and ſo our beſt actions, our beſt workes are but a kind of Miſcellany, not without ſome tincture of faults. And ſince we know nothing in this world that man can do abſolutely perfect, but ſtained with many imperfections; It ſhall ſuffice
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44773:70"/> to content my ſelfe, that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time I have done as wel as I could: And ſince I have endeavoured to doe well, mine owne ſoule and conſcience in the witneſſe of well endeavouring, ſhall be armour of proofe againſt all the aſſaults of reproachfull and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant tongues. When I am older and wiſer, I may chance doe better.</p>
                  <p>Men thinke by cenſuring (though malitiouſly and uncharitably) to be accounted wiſe forſooth, but in a wiſe mans judgement they ſhew themſelves but fooles: For this you may ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the moſt cenſurers, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the moſt malitious fooles, or elſe the moſt ignorant ones: Frequent detractions, reproaches and diſpraiſes, are at beſt but faults of malitious or uncharitable wit, and ſuch wit is folly. And to ſpeake ſooth, (for why ſhould we not call a ſpade, a ſpade, as they ſay) Thoſe men who doe malitiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from, reproach, and abuſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pious men, and their good works and actions, are no better then knaves, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:44773:71"/> as ſome have charactariſed ſuch men to be knaves in graine. This I ſpeake only by way of admonition and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. Let not us therefore by any meanes detract from, ſcandalize, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach or abuſe any mans good, vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pious actions. And if any man doe ſo malitiouſly abuſe us, let us not be ſo unwiſe, as to grieve one jot at the malitious, detractive, reproachfull abuſes of ſuch fooles and knaves; but rather to deſpiſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Though I know my endeavours and skill to be but weak and unworthy, yet ſince they are well intended, I know, heaven accepts of a good wil, and good endeavours, for good deeds, though weakly, and unworthily performed; Therfore I am contented: but if I could doe very well indeed, yet will I look to be repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

As for one or two exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I wil now imagine an honeſt man and a deboiſt, idle, ſwaggering, maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, talking together; The honeſt man ſaying, That the Author of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine good book was very well buſied, when he was writing the ſame, and that the other for ſhame cannot deny this, but rather thinke that hee was much better buſied in writing the ſame, then himſelfe is uſually at the taverne and tap-houſe; but now that he ſtudies how to come in with ſome <hi>if,</hi> or <hi>but,</hi> which he thinks will ſpoile all the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and this is very like to be the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44773:72"/> matter; namely, he ſayes, the authour had done well if he had not printed the ſame, but this printing ſpoiles all, &amp;c. and perchance he then brings out ſome old muſty overworne proverbe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he would faine if he could give you (though ſlyly) to underſtand that all authors are fooles in print, and that himſelfe is a very wiſe man for ſaying ſo, though he very fooliſhly condemne that which perchance himſelfe is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of, much leſſe to perform; but he would not ſhew himſelfe (he ſaith) to be a foole in print by any meanes; And here Momus ſhews his wiſdome, in that he ſo feares, and ſhames to ſhew himſelfe what he is. Hee had rather perchance be a foole more privately, then publiquely: But what? ſhall a man be ſo weake, ſo poore ſpirited, ſo ſimple, as to feare or ſhame to doe well, becauſe of the idle detractions of ſuch men. Baſhfulneſſe in goodneſſe is at beſt but a frayle vertue, or rather a weake unworthy vice; A cowardly feare in well doing, and to ſhew the ſame is vitious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 span">

                  <p>And now concerning my ſelfe: Since I am conſcious to my ſelfe, that I doe intend and endeavour well and honeſtly, I will thinke my ſelfe happy, whatſoever the world judges of me. I will never be aſhamed of that which beares the ſeales of good endeavours and vertue. And why ſhould I be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to doe any thing in private, that I would not that men (aſwell as God and Angels) ſhould know of. I proteſt (before God) I would that all men in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44773:73"/> the world (if it pleaſed him) knew all both the thoughts and actions of my life paſt, ſo as they knew all aſwell good as bad, and my reſolutions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning future time. Why ſhould we endeavour to doe any but good acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſuch as 'tis no matter who ſees how well we are buſied. And what? ſhall we be aſhamed to ſhew that to the world, wherein we have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe well? It is to be reputed an unworthy feare and cowardiſe, that puls a man backe from endeavouring to doe good, and to ſhew the ſame to the world, although there be many men in the world ſo ſordid and fooliſh, and others ſo malitious, bad and kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh, as to reproach and abuſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Having endeavoured to doe well, I will not be aſhamed to ſet my name thereunto, and after good adviſement, to ſhew the ſame publiquely in print; and if I may (as I hope) pleaſe heaven, and doe (though but a little) good thereby, it matters not for mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and abuſes; but only to make
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44773:73"/> me the more happy; for Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe aſſures it, Bleſſed are they that are reviled and ſuffer for goodneſſe. So then let men cenſure me as they will for endeavouring, to doe well, and ſhewing it, I am reſolved to doe more, and I wiſh that many men more in the world, would be more diligent and forward in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>I will further imagine the ſaid <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> is againe diſcourſing to the ſame honeſt man, and by ſome old, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne, thread-bare proverbs, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, would ſeeme to make the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man beleeve if he could, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all moderne authors have ſtollen out of other mens works, that they are theeves of wit, and other as bad names as he can imagine, and ſo would very unworthily, if he could, overthrow the beſt (I take it) of moderne learning and very much goodneſſe; for (as I will imagine the honeſt man tels <hi>Momus</hi>) Firſt, it were now a folly for men meerely to ſtudy, novelties; ſince as King <hi>Solomon</hi> in his time could ſay,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44773:74"/> There is nothing new under the ſunne, ſo that now (as 'tis ſaid) no new thing can be ſaid or written, which hath not been before: yet (as one ſaith) as a childe ſtanding upon a tall mans ſhoulders, may ſee further than the tall man himſelfe: So moderne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, overviewing, new ſtudying, refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and making uſe of others, adding their owne inventions and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and duely ſorting the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new alterations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes of the preſent times, may excell the former and more antient. And by compoſing the ſame in a new manner, method, and ſtile, and by altering, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, abridging, &amp; ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting their matter to other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it may ſeeme to be (and be as uſeful as if it were all) new, and which to do, is often as difficult, and requires well nigh as much art, as wholly the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new matters; and is better to be eſteemed, becauſe more authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Therefore I thinke it now the beſt kind of ſtudy and learning, to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44773:74"/> ſearch, and note the opinions of the beſt and wiſeſt former authors, and ſo to contract, refine, and alter the ſame according to the preſent times, or to any good and neceſſary purpoſes and occaſions. Thus to doe, is ſo farre from theeving, ſtealing, &amp;c. as it is the beſt way that I can thinke of, to learne to be honeſt, juſt, ſincere, vertuous, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ought rather to be called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, diligence, and the beſt way to goodneſſe, and may be very well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the beſt and moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable induſtry and diligence of Bees, who doe gather a ſew combes of honey from the ſweetneſſe of many and divers floures, and yet the floures no whit the worſe, but ſtill remaine as good and pleaſant as before. And I thinke it as good, lawfull, and neceſſary for a ſcholler to make uſe of bookes, as any other profeſſion to uſe the imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tooles, and inſtruments of their art which they cannot be without; for what elſe is their principall art and learning, but to reade, note, ſtudy, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44773:75"/> refine, contrive, digeſt, contract, and ſo to ſhew their learning, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others: and what better and more authenticall way then this, ſo to ſearch and note the opinions of the beſt and moſt commendable authors. Alſo I know not a better courſe then this to avoid idleneſſe, and all manner of vices, and to increaſe in all vertue and goodneſſe. I thinke if all ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whether they be Gentlemen or others, would thus buſie themſelves (though 'twere but a few houres in a day) they would not (eſpecially du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time) be at leiſure to be viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but would very likely gaine very much unexpected, and even unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable happineſſe in time thereby, and ſo not onely doe very much good to themſelves, but to others alſo if they would. And a moſt bleſſed age it were, if men would thus buſie themſelves. Now therefore what a knave (I cannot terme him bad enough) is <hi>Momus,</hi> ſo to ſcandalize and reproach thoſe courſes which ought rather to be highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44773:75"/> and called the beſt and moſt neceſſary learning, induſtry, diligence, art, and way to goodneſſe, happineſſe and the like: This I write, hoping it may doe good to ſome who may have leiſure and bookes enough ſometimes, to exerciſe themſelves in this way, and the rather ſince (concerning my ſelfe) I have found ſo much good and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe thus in reading, noting, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, contracting, ſtudying, dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and writing, as I proteſt I would not loſe for all the choiſeſt earthly happineſſe that the world can produce, as may be gueſſed by a former booke which I have written, entituled, <hi>Heaven within us,</hi> or, <hi>Divine Happineſſe on Earth.</hi> And ſo much pleaſure have I taken (even in being buſie) herein, as I thinke never any man hath in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or vitious courſes. And ſince I finde this ſo good and happy a way, I am reſolved often to trace therein, though all malitious vitious men ſhould continually reproach and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize the ſame and me.</p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:44773:76"/>
                  <p>Yet once more I will imagine <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> telling the honeſt man, that the world is already too full of books, even cloyed, peſtered, annoyed therewith; and that therefore new ones are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; and the honeſt man telling <hi>Momus,</hi> that there are not too many good bookes, and that men (eſpecially ſchollers) may eaſily enquire, and know which are the beſt, and uſe only them; That there are as many, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers minds, as men, and therefore 'tis good that there be many and divers kinds of good bookes; That moſt men are but of plaine and common under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and therefore many plaine and eaſie bookes are neceſſary, That new things are moſt lookt upon and noted, and therefore it is not amiſſe that there be often new good bookes publiſhed, and the like. But admit it be ſo, that the world is cloyed with too many bookes; therefore it is the more requiſite that men ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to collect, refine, and epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize the ſame, and to publiſh that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44773:76"/> which is good, neceſſary, and well pleaſing to vertuous, pious men; and in this reſpect (concerning my ſelfe alſo (if I have failed therein (though I hope not much) yet I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe as well as I could; yet truly my owne meditations, contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo additions in the ſtudying and writing hereof, have extended the book (eſpecially in ſome neceſſary places thereof, where I thought good) much longer then I intended. I ſhould perhaps have pleaſed ſome men, to have cited abundance of authours, to ſhew much reading, and intermixed a multitude of Latine phraſes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, &amp;c. (eſpecially to pleaſe ſuch who thinke all learning is comprized therein.) All which indeed may be performed by a weake ſcholler in this age; inſomuch as a man may eaſily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect even out of moderne Engliſh Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, ſuch matter enough to make a booke ſwel in <hi>Folio,</hi> to a great volume: but in this compendious diſcourſe I thought better to neglect the ſame, and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44773:77"/> ſo to be as briefe as conveniently I could. In this booke I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to uſe ſuch a ſeverall ſtile and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as (according to my weake skil and judgement) becomes the ſeverall matters diſcourſed of in the Treatiſe. And ſince I have been very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in this way by many worthy friends, aſwell Divines, as others (as I can ſhew and 'tis well knowne) under ſome of their hands, I am the more freely willing to commit the ſame to publique view and cenſure, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the common and pernitious ſlanders and reproaches of <hi>Momus, Zoylus,</hi> and their followers.</p>
                  <p>But (if I have digreſſed) to returne. Let us further conſider, that ſome ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and reproaches are even good and neceſſary for us, to purifie, to try, to quicken, and enliven all vertue and divine graces in us. Let us endeavour to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ke a good uſe even of reproches, by bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>g the better, more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and diligent in all goodneſſe, more wiſe, reſolute and contagious
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44773:77"/> therein, and then happy are we; wee may rejoyce rather, then ſorrow at ſuch reproach, that occaſioneth ſuch good effects. And (againe concerning my ſelfe) I confeſſe that if I had not had ſome very ſtrange eager enemies, and been reproached, 'tis very like I had not had the leiſure to have been happy. I proteſt me thinkes I do very plainly perceive that the ſame hath oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned my greateſt joy and felicity; yea, that all the enemies, reproaches, and croſſes of my life, have turned to the increaſe of my good and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; and that the remembrance of them doth now but ſerve to enliven &amp; quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken my preſent joyes. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p>It is common to all men to be evill ſpoken of and reviled, eſpecially reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and pious men moſt undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly; The Apoſtles, Martyrs, and all the Saints have bin ſo abuſed, thoſe men of whom the world was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.36, 38. We doe but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ders; yea our Captaine and Saviour himſelfe hath led this way,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44773:78"/> and he will crowne ſuch with eternall triumphant honour and glory, who patiently follow him in ſuffering. 'Tis a comfort to have ſuch a leader, ſuch companions.</p>
                  <p>Hath God our Saviour moſt loving-ſuffered ſo much to make us happy, and ſhall not we (even willingly and joyfully) ſuffer ſo little for his ſake as the reproach of envious and malitious tongues. Let us be aſhamed to goe to heaven without ſuffering ſomthing for our Saviours ſake.</p>
                  <p>When ill men hate and revile us, it is a ſigne of goodneſſe in us. Such men would love us, if we did uſe and allow their courſes. If we doe well, they will hate and reproach us. Let us then (as the Apoſtles did) rejoyce that wee are worthy to ſuffer for goodnes ſake: Such reproach is a bleſſing, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith it: <hi>Bleſſed are you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>when man ſhall revile, &amp;c. for my ſake, rejoyce, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, Matt.</hi> 6. What a weake conceit have we of heaven, if
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44773:78"/> we cannot willingly ſuffer even death it ſelfe for the leaſt of it's rewards. If we were truly capable thereof, how joyfully ſhould we ſuffer the greateſt torments on earth, to gaine ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; and glory to thinke at what an eaſie rate (in compariſon) we ſhould gaine the ſame. Puny Chriſtians are we, not worthy the name, if we be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hartened at the airy reproach of diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute people, when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Great is your reward in heaven.</hi> Let it then be as heavenly muſicke to our eares, to heare ſuch vitious men, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile and reproach us: We ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with eternall honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in heaven.</p>
                  <p>I reckon (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) that the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. And our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a farre more exceeding and eternall weight of glory. Of this glory let us contemplate, let us lift up our minds
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44773:79"/> to thoſe crownes and thrones of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly honour and glory: from thence let us looke downe on thoſe barking, biteleſſe, vitious men of the world, and ſo being above their malice and reproaches, let us contemne the ſame, and pity them.</p>
                  <p>But ſay? admit we be juſtly ſpoken evill of, that we have plunged our ſelves into ill courſes and actions, whereby we have juſtly deſerved to be ſo (for no man lives without faults) yet let us be contented, let us make a good uſe of our diſgraces, ſo may they be an occaſion of our rejoycing. Let them make us ſee our ill deſervings, repent, and amend, ſeeke and returne to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Oh bleſſed is ſuch diſgrace that bringeth forth ſo good effects.</p>
                  <p>And although there be many impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, brazen-faced people in the world, who can ſcoffe at, and out-beard all modeſt ſhame and honeſty, and ſhameleſly maintaine all vice and wickedneſſe; yet a generous modeſt man will grieve, and be aſhamed of ill-doing.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44773:79"/> It is a ſigne of modeſt grace and goodneſſe, to be aſhamed of, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for our faults; 'tis then good hope that we repent and become new better men; as King <hi>David,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Saint <hi>Auguſtine, Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> and infinite others have done, who had as great faults, and perchance farre greater then we; yet after ſeeing and being aſhamed of their ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they repented, became new men, famous Saints.</p>
                  <p>So let us endeavour as farre as wee may, to imitate all good and excellent men. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> that he was a vaine and vitious youth; but after he made the world amends by his worthy deeds.</p>
                  <p>A generous and modeſt ſhame keeps us from doing ill, and makes us ſtrive to excell in all good things; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that ſuch as are poſſeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, are like to be the beſt men of feweſt faults: And of all others, theſe are they who are moſt like to do great and worthy matters, while obſtinate,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44773:80"/> ſhameleſſe people, who impudently maintaine, and go on in a courſe of vice &amp; wickednes, without remorſe, are like to come to diſhonour and ruine: Such men indeed, however they may bee eſteemed in this world, noble, brave, gallant blades; yet while they remain unconverted in ſuch vitious courſes, they are baſe and diſhonourable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſlaves to their owne diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red luſts and affections. Whereas (in a wiſe mans eyes, there cannot be a greater honour to a man even in this world, then to become of ſuch a noble temper, and free ſpirit, as to conquer his irregular affections, and to returne from vitious unworthy courſes, into the wayes of divine grace and vertue, which makes a man to become Lord of himſelfe in this life, and at the end thereof (by Gods grace) guerdons him with eternall honour in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. And it ſeems God himſelfe and Angels rejoyce at this; There is more joy in Heaven (ſaith our Saviour) for one Sinner that repenteth, then
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44773:80"/> ninety and nine juſt Perſons, which need no repentance. Happy are we, and with everlaſting honour and glory ſhall we be crowned, if we be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch joy in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now a few words concerning diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable and deſpiſed men, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Oh what pitty it is to thinke, how many hard and evill-hearted men there are in the world, who being ſomewhat richer, and perchance therefore onely better eſteemed in the world, doe very inſolently ſcorne, contemne, mocke, ſcoffe, reproach, and abuſe poore men of a low and meane degree. But ſirs, thinke I pray, Oh thinke that God might juſtly have made you the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, meaneſt, and moſt deſpiſed man in the world; and that it ſhewes a very maligne and ſatanicall heart, unjuſtly to deſpiſe, reproach, mocke, abuſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over, and ſo adde to the griefe and miſery of ſuch men who are already moſt low, contemned, and miſerable. But let ſuch low, deſpiſed men, know that God himſelfe, who is moſt juſt,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44773:81"/> ſees their miſery and wrongs, and will one day redreſſe the ſame; And if they can be patient, and goe on in well-doing, they ſhall hereafter be crowned with glory, honour, immortality, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis moſt like (however they may thinke otherwiſe) that diſgrace, infamy and contempt, makes many men the better, eſpecially frees them from pride, vaine-glory, inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ambition, and alſo makes them more humble and meeke: And with ſuch God himſelfe dwels, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57.15. He promiſes them grace and exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. There are very many gratious promiſes in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the meeke and humble. The kingdome of heaven is theirs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5. where they ſhall be crowned with eternall honour and glory, and ſet with heavenly Princes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.7. So if they can be the better and more humble for their diſgrace, wrongs, and low condition, their light momentary affliction ſhall worke for them a farre
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44773:81"/> more exceeding eternal weight of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Such heavenly glory and honor, as is not worthy to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with their diſgraces and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18.</p>
                  <p>Deſpiſed men, you whom the world ſcornes and reproaches; how happy, how honourable are you if you be vertuous and pious? Since God himſelfe is your father, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven your reward, ſince it is your fathers good pleaſure to give you a kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. Feare not then, but rejoyce, for you have ſo much cauſe of joy (if you can ſee it) enough to make you unexpreſſably, yea infinitely and everlaſtingly joyful. To you Chriſt himſelfe ſhall one day ſay, Come you bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdome prepared for you from the beginning of the world, <hi>Matt.</hi> 25. Be then but Gods ſervants, and you are moſt honourable freemen. His ſervice is perfect freedome. Then however you may be deſpiſed, diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and miſerable in this world; yet
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44773:82"/> are you ſuch of whom the world is not worthy (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.36, 38.) moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and honourable even in the ſight of heaven. You are the ſonnes of the moſt high God, guarded by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and feared by devils. Eternity and the kingdome of heaven are prepared for your honour and glory. Can you or dare you wiſh greater honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe? Who will not ſay then, but ſuch men are moſt happy, and right honourable?</p>
                  <p>Concerning poore deſpiſed men, you may ſee or collect more conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before in the firſt partition, and fourth Section.</p>
                  <p>Let us then bee contented and not too much feare the loſſe of honour, or grieve for the want thereof, ſince there may bee ſuch happineſſe even in the good uſe of Reproach, Contempt, and Diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>To diſcourſe yet further concerning this ſubject of Contentment in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of honour alſo. Why ſhould we feare the loſſe, or grieve for the want of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44773:82"/> outward pomp and honour ſince (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true that in it ſelfe, and in the good uſe thereof, it is of much worth and excellency, as hath been ſhewed, yet) in compariſon of the eternall glory and honour of heaven, it is to be eſteemed even as nothing, either in reſpect of time or worth. Inſomuch as in ſuch compariſon, it is more glory to deſpiſe honour, then to attaine it, to contemne and be above the world, then to conquer it; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſince after ſuch attaining and conqueſt, a man knowes not what to doe with it, and after a moment of time, in compariſon of eternity, it paſſeth away from man, or man from it.</p>
                  <p>Yea ſome have found that honour hath been rather a loſſe then a gaine, but an occaſion of envy, jealouſie, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſtormes, and ſometimes of poverty or death it ſelfe; Witneſſe thoſe worthies, <hi>Themiſtocles, Phocian, Ariſtides, Scipio, Cicero, Seneca, Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and divers others. Many alſo have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44773:83"/> found the ſame but honourable ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and troubles. All earthly things ſhew to us perchance better then they are, and ſometimes the devill alſo may tempt us (as he went about to tempt Chriſt) and ſo (in our contemplations) ſhew us the kingdomes and glory of the world; but not the dangers, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, cares, feares, and vigilancies thereof: Thus eſpecially hee tempts ambitious men; but many men who have duely conſidered theſe effects of honour, and how the ſame may often hinder peace, quietneſſe, alſo divine ſtudies, and reſolutions, have rather thought themſelves happy without then with it; inſomuch as many Kings and Princes have voluntarily forſaken and refuſed it. <hi>Diocleſian, Sylla, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Martellus, Ottanes</hi> King of Perſia, Pope <hi>Celeſtinus, Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and eight crowned Kings of England, while it was held of the Saxons, and many others, (though it hath been thought ſuperſtition, and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for men ſo to forſake their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44773:83"/> offices and callings) have changed their Scepters for books, knowing there was leſſe trouble, and (perchance more peace, joy, and felicity, in a ſtudy then in a kingdome. He that is guided by reaſon, and loves himſelfe, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with an indifferent fortune. Likewiſe divers of the ſaints in all ages, even the Apoſtles have volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily refuſed outward honour; and our Saviour himſelfe, ſetting before him the glory of heaven (as 'tis ſaid) wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endured the croſſe, and deſpiſed the ſhame. For in ſuch compariſon of eternal and heavenly glory, this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, terreſtriall honour, is not worthy to be eſteemed, but as altogether vain, as meere aire, breath, clouds, miſts, vapours, ſhadowes, dreames, yea leſſe, even as nothing. It doth not ſo much as touch a man, onely his name, which is nothing of his ſubſtance, a thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the aire from him, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, fugitive, and undurable: So that if an ambitious man were but awaked out of his vaine-glorious
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44773:84"/> dreame, reſtored to his wits, brought out of fooles paradiſe, he would plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee how in the proſecution of this vanity, he did but run paths very vain, devious and dangerous, onely to build caſtles in the aire, or (according to a better phraſe) to ſow the winds, and reap the whirlwinds. Then would hee remaine even moſt ſweetly contented with a meane condition.</p>
                  <p>So uncertaine and undurable is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that one day hath ſeene <hi>Haman</hi> honoured and hanged: So <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> a King and a beaſt, <hi>Bajazet</hi> an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and a caged priſoner (I might inſtance in many more.) But if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne of a man doth make a longer noyſe in the world, a life time or more, yet to what a ſmall purpoſe is it, ſince 'tis but a noyſe that paſſeth away with a thought; and ſince the man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo paſſeth away to nothing, or worſe to death, the grave, and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where is now great <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe valour could admit no compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, whoſe victories have ſpread

So alſo <hi>Caeſar, Marke Antony, Pompey, Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, Scipio</hi> and all the reſt who have bin regiſtred in the world for famous? They are dead, and parted from their glory. And to what a ſmall purpoſe is all their conqueſts, their honour and glory come to, ſince even the very wormes have conquered them all, and reduced them to nothing but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I am even aſtoniſht, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſo great a number of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Kings, Princes, Prelates, Nobles, who have commanded the world, ſhould now be conquered by ſo poore and contemptible things, as death, and the wormes, and be impriſoned for ever in a narrow darkſome grave, and there to become onely a lump of filth, a box of pallid putrifaction, a neſt of crawlers, ſo full of gaſtlineſſe and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44773:85"/> as you would be even afraid to looke upon them.</p>
                  <p>Let us be contented then, and not be ambitious, or envy any mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory. No? not if an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, vitious, impious man, ſhould grow great and honourable in the world. <hi>Be not afraid</hi> (ſaith King <hi>David) when the glory of his houſe increaſeth, for he ſhall carry nothing away with him when he dieth, neither ſhall his pomp fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, Pſal.</hi> 49.16. What difference is there between the moſt honourable, and the moſt deſpiſed man in the grave. The poore deſpiſed mans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, his exceſſe to heaven is as free (and 'tis like freer with leſſe impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) then the other, and his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the earth, not ſo grievous, ſince he hath no pomp and glory, but rather infamy, diſgrace, and miſery, to depart from, and (if hee be a pious Chriſtian) he expects a crown of glory in heaven.</p>
                  <p>Why then ſhould wee too much feare the loſſe, or grieve for the want
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44773:85"/> of externall honour and glory, ſince (as hath been ſhewed) in reſpect of the eternall and heavenly, which wee expect to poſſeſſe, it is not worth our thoughts, but (in ſuch compariſon) appeares altogether vaine, fading and undurable, as alſo the poſſeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And it is moſt worthy conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſuch ſpirits as are divine enough to contemne earthly, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the heavenly honour and glory (which they looke for, and in ſome ſort already view by a heavenly light in their ſoules) are the moſt happy men. The renowne of a vertuous pious man is much greater, and more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then that of <hi>Caeſar</hi> or <hi>Alexander;</hi> And this honour onely laſteth eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we have this honour, it matters not for any other; we need not care which way we goe, whether thtough honour or diſhonour on earth, ſo wee come to that glory in heaven. Let us truſt and relye on God, and we are however bleſſed. God makes us to be borne, and live in what degree he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44773:86"/> If we live in a mean, low, and deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed condition among men till death, God hath ſo ordained; So it muſt be: And if we can (as if we were divinely wiſe, we may) even willingly, and with ſweeteſt contentment, obey his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decrees, and relye on his divine providence, without diſtruſt, we are certainly happy. It ſhould (and why ſhould it not) be an heaven of joy to us, to thinke that God (whom wee ſhould love Infinitely above our ſelves) is in heaven, &amp; that his name is glorified, and his will is done on earth as in heaven.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then, let us in reſpect of worldly honor, rely on Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence what ever befals us, knowing that if we truſt in him, we ſhall have that which is moſt good, moſt fit for for us; Let us make a good uſe both of honour and diſhonour. And ſo we may (and let us endeavour to be) contented and rejoyce in this reſpect, and ſo in all things.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the vaine immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ambitious deſire of praiſe and honour bee not good, yet the moderate and vertuous deſire thereof is certainly very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and alſo profitable, aſwell for private as publick good; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines men in their duty, awakens, ſtirs up, and inflames them to worthy and honourable actions; and may ſerve to many good and divine uſes. Such ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour (therefore) and good eſtimation, as we have, let us uſe the ſame well, and in the good uſe thereof enjoy it freely.</p>
                  <p>However many vitious men uſe this treaſure of Honour to many ill purpoſes, to the countenance and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of vice and impiety, and ſo perhaps to their owne ruine; and doe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44773:87"/> deſire and ſeeke the ſame in a vain and vitious way, onely to ſatisfie their pride, arrogancy, covetouſneſſe, and other ill deſires; yet vertuous pious men can deſire and uſe the ſame to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good ends and purpoſes, as to the benefit of themſelves, their family, the common-wealth, the Church, and in all reſpects to the glory of God, and ſo can truly enjoy much pleaſure and felicity therein; and embrace the ſame as a bleſſing and gift of God, as a little foretaſte of that honour and glory which they expect to enjoy in heaven. And by this good and divine uſe of honour, to bee excited to ſearch, taſte, ſee, and enjoy (in ſome meaſure even on earth) that heavenly honour and glory, is that which I principally intend to diſcourſe of in this Section.</p>
                  <p>This terreſtriall honour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe is a little reflection from the lightening wherewith heaven illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates divine ſoules, directing them to the acquiſition of the true ſource and fountaine of all honour, glory, and
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44773:87"/> happineſſe, by the aide of theſe ſmall ſprings and rivolets. Let then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and ſplendency of this terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall honour, ſtirre us up to view, ſearch, and enjoy that eternall honour and glory of heaven, which in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures is called a kingdome in divers places, the kingdome of God and of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.2. and 6.33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A heavenly kingdome, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.18. A kingdome prepared for, and to be given to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. A crowne which (in expectation and in divine glorious and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, and ſo in viſion) wee may already have, and are adviſed to hold faſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.11. and wee are by that Prince of Kings, Ieſus Chriſt, already made and called Kings and Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God his father, to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5, 6. Great men, ambitious men, deſpiſed men, all men harke to this heavenly language, which moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly tels us we may (and bids us ſeek to) poſſeſſe ſuch a Kingdome, ſuch a
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44773:88"/> crowne, ſuch honour and glory, as if we were truly capable thereof, would make us even on earth ſo high and heavenly minded, as even to diſdaine (in compariſon thereof) the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious earthly honour, but only ſo farre as it may ſerve to the furtherance and increaſe of this heavenly honour and glory; and then ſhould we bend all our choiſeſt deſires and endeavours to ſeek this honour and glory of God, of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                  <p>But by the way let me ſay, or rather let the ſacred Oracles of God tell us, that before this honour is humility, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.33. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.52. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.6. and divers other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. We ſhould deny and eſteeme our ſelves, as the Laodiceans, wretched, miſerable, poore, blinde, naked (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17.) and ſo denying our ſelves, wee ſhould looke up to Chriſt Ieſus our Redeemer and Saviour, and as hee counſels us (<hi>ver.</hi> 18.) buy of him pure gold, white rayment, &amp;c. all divine and heavenly graces, and ſo thereby
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44773:88"/> live well, graciouſly, piouſly; for to ſuch as ſo live, is this honour and glory promiſed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. and 91.14, 15, 16, and 149.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7, 10. So then though we muſt deny our ſelves, yet in Chriſt Ieſus, if we be endued with his heavenly graces, and ſo live well, we ought to think our ſelves rich, honourable, happy, and illuſtrious, even in the ſight of God and Angels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. that we are as Kings children, and all-glorious within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.14. faire as the moone, cleere as the ſun, and terrible as an army with banners, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6.10. even the ſonnes of God, and heires of the kingdome of heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6, 7. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. Kings and Prieſts unto God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.6. Such honor have all his Saints, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.9.</p>
                  <p>So then let our deſignes be ſo high and heavenly, even as to acquire a kingdome, a heavenly kingdome, the kingdome of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.33. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. In him let us ſeeke for glory, honour, immortality, eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. We all deſire to be honourable, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44773:89"/> the way ſo be moſt truly and highly honourable, is to ſeeke for this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glory of heaven, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the poore and deſpiſed mans only hope and life, and ought to be the well reputed, and noble mans onely ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and this hope, this deſire (if di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly enough) and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition thereof, is by Gods grace ſufficient to ennoble even the moſt deſpiſed man on earth, with honor and happineſſe, far more worth then this world can give or imagine.</p>
                  <p>What now, if the diſhonourable ſlaves of ſinne and wickedneſſe (thoſe whom God himſelfe hath branded with the ignoble names of ſwine, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.6. and dogs, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15. who neither ſee nor know thoſe heavenly dignities, honours, and glories of the Saints of God) ſhould trample thoſe divine pearles of grace, and barke at thoſe heavenly honoured men, yet let us be contented; we know 'tis the nature of the beaſts and curs; &amp; ſo let them wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in their filth, and ſnarle at us ſtill,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44773:89"/> it matters not while we are ſo happy as to know theſe truths (oh would they were ſo happy alſo) that we are ſo hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable as to be the ſervants of God, yea his ſonnes, and heires of the kingdome of heaven, as hath been ſhewed. And yet further, now lately ſearching thoſe heavenly Oracles, I find that God is pleaſed ſo to honour us, as to call us (ſo farre as we are good and happy) his owne image, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. yea the very divine nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. the temples of the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19 6.16. wherein God himſelfe dwels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.12, 13, 15, 16. the beloved of God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the glory of God and of Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.22. With divers other, hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, glorious, and heavenly excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, enough to make us exceeding joyfull and very gloriouſly high and heavenly minded, even in the midſt of all the reproaches and abuſes that the devill and all his imps can imagine againſt piety and pious men; and ſo to contemne the ſame, even as we would
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44773:90"/> the barking of a biteleſſe cur, or rather (as hath bin ſaid before) to eſteem the ſame as heavenly muſicke and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſince it doth ſerve but to increaſe this our heavenly honour and glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>Now then let us raiſe up our thoughts and deſires from this terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall, to the heavenly glory; let it be our onely ambition to reſt in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour on earth, and to be crowned with eternall glory in heaven: And in the meane time, let us often pray with <hi>Moſes,</hi> O Lord we beſeech thee ſhew us thy glory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.18. and often endeavour already to ſoare aloft upon the wings of faith and divine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation unto this heavenly glory, thoſe everlaſting heavenly glorious crownes, and thrones, which wee ſhall hereafter poſſeſſe. Let this earthly glory and honour be an help to direct our ſoules thither, and to learne the excellency of that infinitely, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent eternall glory of heaven, from which this earthly, as a little bright
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44773:90"/> reflection doth proceed.</p>
                  <p>And as children by the uſe and view of toyes and trifles, ſuch as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, are encouraged to learn (and doe thereby eſpy) the way to greater excellencies, and after ſeeing the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe toyes, and looking above them, doe even contemne them in compariſon of the more excellent things which then they know: So let us (as children in Gods family) make a good uſe of this earthly honour, and be thereby encouraged and excited to learne and ſearch the way to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory of heaven; of which this is but a ſhadow: And when we are grown wiſe and skilfull men in rhe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of divine things, Let us then in compariſon endeavour to be above, and even contemne theſe toyes and trifles of the world, for ſuch is earthly honour even in it's greateſt excellency in compariſon of the heavenly honour and glory; and then let us untye our ſelves from the overmuch, and viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſire of terreſtriall honor, which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44773:91"/> can never ſatisfie us, and with a deſire full of ſprightfulneſſe, love, and joy, elevate our thoughts to heaven, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for certaine it is, that thoſe ſouls which doe often contemplate the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, and doe well know the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency thereof, are often raiſed farre above all the greatneſſe of the earth, inaſmuch as eternity is above time, and infinite glory above a ſhadow thereof. And in theſe contemplations, they are often ſo tranſported and raiſed beyond and above themſelves, as if they were then capable of terreſtriall and humane vanities, they would not know themſelves, while their ſouls doe thus direct their lookes, deſires, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and contemplations wholly to God himſelfe to heaven. Inſomuch that while their ſpirits are ſo rayſed in ſuch divine thoughts and illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they doe ſeeme very gloriouſly then to deſpiſe all the honour and greatneſſe of the earth, and with unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſable delight to marke out the thrones of their honour in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44773:91"/> of heaven; where they know that a crowne of immortall glory ſhall for ever environ their heads. And in theſe divine thoughts and elevations, they are often even aſtoniſht with ſuch wonderfull delights and happineſſe, as they can finde neither meaſure, nor li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits in theſe divine glorious amuze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, heavenly irradiations, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>So not being able to find any thing on earth, worthy of their greatneſſe, they have deſigned the crowne, and ſet up the throne of their honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the empyrean heaven.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, Let it alwaies be our glory to glorifie our fathet which is in heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Ier.</hi> 9.23. They that honour me, I will honour, ſaith God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.30. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.14, 15, 16. O how honourable, how happy is he whom God is pleaſed to honour. Teach (oh Lord) this ſecret divine language to my heart, to deſire onely thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, thy glory, and that I may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44773:92"/> glory onely in thee who art mans ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne glory, yea onely, true happines. Let me eſteeme this honour, this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this happineſſe, as heaven alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>

When that <hi>Hermits</hi> boy, who had alwaies been brought up in the wilderneſſe, came firſt abroad in the world, was asked what pleaſed him beſt therein; readily replyed, Thoſe things which you call women. A ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44773:95"/> woman (ſaith King <hi>Solomon</hi>) is a crowne to her husband, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4. Much more (in divers Authours) I finde in commendations of women, and I wiſh that they did deſerve the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Loves excellency alſo appeares in reſpect of the parties affected; The braveſt, the moſt noble, generous and gallant ſpirits are commonly moſt and beſt taken, and poſſeſt with this Love; wherefore it is called heroicall Love. It is ſaid to be a true note of a worthy generous minde, and of the moſt ingenious ſchollers, to be in love, eſpecially in their youthfull yeres; for rude and dull underſtandings cannot raiſe their thoughts to bee capable of thoſe high, ſweet, and delicate fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which we ſee that Love uſually produces, in ſuch worthy, generous, and ingenuous minds.</p>
                  <p>And the parts of man affected alſo, are his moſt excellent parts, as the heart, liver, bloud, and braines (as Phiſitians ſay) and conſequently the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44773:96"/> imagination and reaſon. I ſay reaſon, for want of Love, ſhewes want of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, either ſtupidity or peeviſhneſſe in a man. Yet it is moſt certaine that divine Love is infinitely more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and above this humane love, and ſuch men as are of a divine temper, may eaſily overcome the ſame; but we all have bodies aſwell as ſoules; we are compoſed of humanity aſwell as divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and he that never felt the power of this Love, may be eſteemed as ſome Eunuch or ſot, or elſe of a ſuper-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane temper. And on the other ſide, exceſſe of love ſhewes weakneſſe, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſſe, and folly, and then theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts of man are miſaffected. Such love is without reaſon. But true love is moſt agreeable thereunto, and therefore excellent.</p>
                  <p>And further, the excellency of this Conjugall or Marriage-Love, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the effects thereof, which are many: To inſtance in ſome of them. This Love excites men unto honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble actions and enterpriſes, takes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44773:96"/> away cowardiſe, covetouſneſſe, rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and makes men couragious, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall, civill, courteous, loving, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and of a gracefull demeanor, quickens, enlarges, and illuminates the mind. Inſomuch as many worthy and ingenious lovers, their minds have thereby growne ſo quicke, aiery and ſpirituall, as their high, ſoaring, nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and pleaſing fancies, have concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and delivered moſt excellent, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and delightfull Poems, Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. as if the Authors ſeemed to be more beholding to Love then to the Muſes.</p>
                  <p>This Love preſerves and increaſes mankinde in a perpetuall generation; and unites Families, Provinces, and Kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid there is no earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe like this of the ſweet ſociety of true-lovers in the way of marriage, and of a loving husband and wife; their joyes are doubled and redoubled by Love. How ſweetly may they counſell aſſiſt, and comfort one another in all things.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:44773:97"/>
                  <p>By this bleſſed union, the number of parents, friends, and kindred is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. It may be an occaſion of ſweet and lovely children, who in after-times may be a very great joy and felicity to their parents; and theſe may remaine as living pictures, to ſhew their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory from generation to generation. <hi>Lyſippus, Mentor, Polycletus, Zeuxis,</hi> or <hi>Parthaſius,</hi> had neere the skill to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave or paint the father and mother never ſo well and lively. And great is the pleaſure that loving Parents enjoy in their children.</p>
                  <p>A multitude of felicities, a million of joyfull and bleſſed effects ſpring from true love. And indeed this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall or marriage love and ſociety, ſweetens all other actions, diſcourſes, all other pleaſures and felicities, and even in all reſpects increaſes true joy and happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>This Love alſo may excite us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly Love. But of this ſubject I intend to write in the fifth Section of this Partition.</p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:44773:97"/>
                  <p>This bleſſedneſſe and excellency of Love will be more apparent, if wee conſider the miſeries either of the loſſe of ſuch love before, or of the want thereof after marriage. It is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to thinke how many lovers for loſſe or want of enjoying their wiſhes in this kinde, plunge themſelves into a multitude of cares, feares, ſorrowes, blindneſſe, dotage, ſervitude, ſlavery, miſchiefe, and miſeries. Many men will venture their goods, fame, lives, and (as king <hi>Iohn</hi> for <hi>Matilda</hi>) crownes if they had them, to enjoy their loves.</p>
                  <p>Sorrow, dejection, much waking, ſighing, neglects, peeviſhneſſe, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thoughts, brutiſh attempts, want of appetite, paleneſſe, and leanneſſe, are common effects and ſymptomes of the want of enjoying, and of the loſſe of love. And millions of men having loſt their loves, become therefore me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, diſcontented and dejected all their life time after; And many there be (ſaith <hi>Zorobabel</hi>) that have run out of their wits for women, and become
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44773:98"/> ſervants for their ſakes, <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 4.26. Theſe things are commonly knowne; Bedlam hath been full of examples. Many alſo have periſhed, have erred, and ſinned for women, <hi>Eſdr.</hi> 4.27. Examples hereof alſo have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all ages. Hiſtories are full of them: And many that have conſum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d away, and died for want of enjoying and loſing their loves; yea, ſome for griefe thereof have been their owne executioners, and made themſelves away.</p>
                  <p>And after marriage, it is ſtrange to thinke what jealouſies, contentions, feares, ſorrowes, ſtrange actions, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, lookes, bitter words, outrages, and debates are betweene men and their wives, for want of true love and diſcretion. And how many men for want of this love, have turned whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters; and alſo divers men, not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at home, fly abroad, and ſo become Taverne and Alehouſe hunters, diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute people, ſpoile themſelves, and wrong their families. Theſe miſeries
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44773:98"/> have alwaies been, and are ſo common to all mens view, as they need but little diſquiſition.</p>
                  <p>Since it appeares that true love is ſo excellent, and the contrary ſo irke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and miſerable, it is requiſite therefore in the next place, that we do even very diligently learne and view the way to this excellent happineſſe of Conjugall or Marriage Love.</p>

                     <hi>SECTION. II.</hi> Shewing how to love truly, enjoy our wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, pleaſe our lovers, and increaſe Love.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat wee may truly love, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our Loves, enjoy them, and live well together, firſt let us make a good choiſe in Love. Such are moſt like to obtaine their loves who chuſe well and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently; for there is no greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to love then this, when there is a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44773:99"/> fit and convenient ſympathy in all things between them. Hee who hath made ſuch a good and convenient choiſe in Love, may even juſtly hope to have almoſt gained his love already. One word, one ſmile between ſuch, will cauſe more love then many words and gifts betweene others. Diverſities breed nothing but diſunion, and ſweet congruity is the cauſe of Love. Hence growes the height of love and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, when two ſimillary ſoules ſhall joyne in all their commixions and this aſſimulation, pure and good in all things. Thoſe are obſerved to agree and love beſt, who are both alike of good conditions, both wiſe and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious. And it is the crown of bleſſings to live in ſuch happineſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore piety and vertue be the firſt mover of our affections; and the rather, to chuſe well, let us take that Divines counſell, who wiſheth us to invite Chriſt to our wedding, and to pray to him for a good wife, or elſe none at all, which he thinks beſt for
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:44773:99"/> us; for an evill woman (as the wiſe man ſaith) makes a ſorry countenance, and an heavy heart, and a man had rather dwell with a Lyon, then keep houſe with ſuch a wife, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 29.27. and he that hath her, is as if he held a Scorpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. What is to be ſeene among ſuch husbands and wives, as are of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and impious conditions, but ſtrife, tumults, diſorder, ſuſpition, confuſion, and miſery in the end; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as none live more lovingly, pleaſantly, and happily together, then ſuch as are of gracious &amp; vertuous conditions. A vertuous &amp; well given lover is much better to be eſteemed then a fine face with ill conditions. Let us not then be ſo ſenſuall, as to love onely the face and corps, but looke higher, and ſee ſomething in our lovers of an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall nature, that is, a free, vertuous and gracious mind; which to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding man, appeares to be a divine Eſſence, and to which he mingles his ſoule in Love; which (if truly thought on) will appeare to be a farre more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44773:100"/> and permanent Love then that of the body, and conſequently more pleaſant. A vertuous pious wife is far more pretious then rubies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.10 She is as the Kings daughter, all-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. So then let us ſpheare our Loves, and ſeeke beauty rather in a minde then in a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                  <p>In the next place after piety, vertue and good conditions, it is requiſite to looke after corporall and externall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, and as neere as we may, to chuſe ſuch as are of equall yeares, birth, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and degree, of good parentage and kindred, of ſuch a countenance, complexion, and conſtitution as beſt agrees to our love and diſpoſition; for inconſiderate and unequall marriages are commonly very pernitious, and a multitude of miſchievous and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effects ſpring from ſuch marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; As if a ſound and healthy perſon marries one that is diſeaſed and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; if an honeſt man marries a whore; or an honeſt woman a knave;
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44773:100"/> if one that is well tempered in minde, marry a phantaſtick, adle-pated, brain-ſicke, ſcolding piece; or if one that's young, marry with an old doting com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, or in any othar reſpects very unfitly, what better ſucceſſe can they look for then <hi>Minos</hi> had with <hi>Paſiphaë, Vulcan</hi> with <hi>Venus, Menelaus</hi> with <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Ptolomny</hi> with the whoriſh <hi>Thais, Claudius</hi> with the luſtfull <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> or <hi>Hierome</hi> King of Sicily, with <hi>Pytho.</hi> What is like to enſue but ſuſpition, jealouſie, ſtrife, ſhame, ſorrow, diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and miſery. Therefore it is very requiſite that men ſhould love and marry ſuch as are equall, fit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for them.</p>
                  <p>It is a good time, as ſome ſay, for a man to marry between five and twenty yeare old and thirty, and for a woman between her age of eighteen, and two and twenty. And it ſeemes better (ſaith one) to love below then above ones ſelfe in eſtate and degree; for (ſaith he) this will the more oblige a lover to be the more loving, diligent, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44773:101"/> ever after. But notwithſtanding we may truly ſay, that although light-headed, phantaſticke, proud, malapert women (as many of them are) will be the worſe for a good eſtate and paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; yet a good woman (though there be not many ſuch) will be rather the better then worſe for the ſame. But however it is thought beſt, as neere as men may with conveniency, to chuſe ſuch as are of fit and convenient yeres, birth, fortunes, degree, parentage, conſtitution, and eſpecially of like vertuous and gratious conditions; for when two meet of the ſame good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what is it but the ſame ſoule in two bodies, or rather in one body, ſince marriage ſo unites, as they are no more two, but one fleſh, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.5.6. as it were two perſons intermutually tranſported into one another. So that even with the ſame reaſon that we love our ſelves, we love thoſe that are ſo like and united to us. But yet it ſeemes beſt to chuſe (if we may) ſuch as are more vertuous and gracious then our
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44773:101"/> ſelves; for to live with ſuch ('tis good hope and like) will in time make us the more like them, and conſequently, the better and more happy.</p>
                  <p>The choiſe hereof being eſteemed the chiefeſt action of our life, moſt neerely concerning us, and from whence ſprings our future good and happineſſe, ought to be very diligently thought on, and conſidered; and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that we chuſe ſuch a one, as from our hearts we can truly, and for good cauſes love dearely. From ſuch a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, fit, equall and good choyce, is like to ſpring abundance of moſt ſweet delights and felicities.</p>
                  <p>Having made a good choyſe, wee may and ſhould uſe all good meanes to gaine Love, to pleaſe our Lovers, and encreaſe Love, which in ſuch a good convenient choyce, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and very like to be happily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, even by ſuch ordinary and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meanes, as are commonly uſed by lovers, and preſcribed in divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for the ſame purpoſe; but as
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44773:102"/> for thoſe common allurements and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of love, which ſome Authors write of largely; as pleaſant, comely, and well compoſed geſtures, pace, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, behaviour; alſo of glances, ſmiles, ſalutations, complements, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, familiarity, gifts, tokens, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, letters, meetings, feaſts, wine, muſicke, amorous tales, ſinging, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and the like: I liſt not to treat of, and the rather, becauſe (if all theſe things were well uſed onely to good purpoſes (as ſome of them are often too much abuſed; yet) they are ſo uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practiſed by, and even naturall to lovers, as they need but little diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>Time, place, and opportunity often occaſioneth love. Alſo importunity to ſome kinde of women; and ſometimes alſo (I know that) neglect and ſcorne doth in ſome of theſe female kinds, much increaſe love; for ſome of them are of ſuch proud, imperious conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they will inſult over, and even ſcorne ſuch puny lovers, as will be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44773:102"/> pinned upon their ſleeves. Hence it is, women are compared to ſhadowes; if we follow them, they will goe from us; if we goe away, they will follow us againe; wherefore ſometimes to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, ſeemeth better then importunity, and whetteth love Though indeed ſuch as will not be gained either without much importunity, or much neglect, are to be thought no whit the better in that reſpect, but rather they may be thought the more nice, proud, or ſcornfull, or elſe that they thinke their lovers not good enough, or not fit and convenient for them.</p>
                  <p>But that which in this reſpect I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend only to treat ſo at large, is, Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall diſcourſe; yet before I begin, let me tel you that I think it a very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary &amp; good deed, to endevour to help and comfort ſuch as are afflicted and need comfort, and who need the ſame more then lovers.

But now if ſome well given, faire conditioned young man (for to ſuch I chiefly direct this diſcourſe) ſhall withall adde a ſweet, pleaſing, convincing, and materiall diſcourſe to his Lover (whom I will imagine to be alike vertuous and well conditioned young creature) it will be indeed ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſweetly to captivate, charme, and even overcome them, to fill their hearts full of joy and pleaſure, and ſo to inchant them, as it is like they will ever after be joyned together in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble bond of true flaming love.</p>
                     <p>Now for the manner and matter of our diſcourſe; I have alwaies thought it vanity and lightneſſe, rather then courteſie, to diſcourſe (according to the Gallants faſhion of our times) by
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44773:105"/> meere Complements Congies, apiſh geſtures, and meere finicall words; To ſay, Sweet Miſtreſſe, or Madame, I honour your ſhoo-ſtrings, the ground you tread upon, am proud to kiſſe your hand, it is my ambition to be your ſervants ſervant, and the like; to preſent and offer, not only our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, but lives to the command of our Miſtreſſes, as wee uſe to call them, though God knowes, we never meane to be their ſervants. On the other ſide, I think it alſo folly to ſtudy, ſing, and talke to them in high ſtraines of wit, and figurative exornations, leſt they bee not underſtood, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance laughed at. But in this reſpect a plaine, yet artificiall, pleaſing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, moving, and convincing way is beſt.</p>
                     <p>I doe not intend to preſcribe a ſet Method to diſcourſe in; for why, me thinkes a premeditated ſet diſcourſe ſhewes ſomething a barrenneſſe of wit, though not of judgement: and is commonly uttered with little paſſion
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44773:105"/> or feeling (which is in ſome meaſure taken away by premeditation) and conſequently not ſo freely, lively, and with ſuch a grace as otherwiſe, unleſſe we can counterfeit (like a Player) our paſſions, and have wit enough to come out, and in, upon all occaſions of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. On the otherſide; we are not ſtraitened in this ſubject for want of matter to diſcourſe of, on all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, even in an extemporary manner; for every ſmile, action, object, event, or ſpeech, may afford a Lover matter of ſudden diſcourſe: and indeed love of it ſelf if it be fervent, whets the wit, and ſo ſtirs up the ſpirits, that we may ſay of Lovers, as of fine wits; They can make uſe of any thing. But neither of this extemporary diſcourſe is my intention to write of, but rather a mixture of both, which I will call, an habit of diſcourſe, or, an extempore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Method: A Method not ſo much to diſcourſe in, as to diſcourſe by, in an extemporary manner; in ſuch ſort as a man may be furniſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44773:106"/> abilities of diſcourſe in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Method, (as I may ſay) or a ſudden and well compoſed manner, without brainſicke, light, idle, frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prating on the one ſide, or too much pumping for wit on the other ſide; but with a ready, yet perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and materiall diſcourſe on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                     <p>But this Art of diſcourſe in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, concerning all matters, will not eaſily be given to weake Novices, (yet the meere obſervation thereof may do even ſuch men ſome good concerning this matter of love) but in generall, It will rather require that a man be well learned and experienced in the liberall Sciences, eſpecially ſuch as he ſhall have moſt occaſion to diſcourſe of: So as he may readily on all occaſions di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the matter of this diſcourſe by the rules and grounds of this art, which are as follow: By Number, Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, Obſervations, Arguments, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, Compariſons, Similitudes, Contrarieties, Appendances, Effects,

                           <l>a taſte of heaven.</l>

                     </p>
                     <p>Or by the Effects of love; To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance among many and divers in a few. That Love cauſes a man to carry himſelfe fairely, courteouſly, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and vertuouſly to all men; It quickens and raiſes a mans ſpirits, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, wit, and makes him become plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, neate, ſpruce, lively, a Poet, a Muſitian, a Dancer, a man of fine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. It makes us enjoy all things in the world with a ſweeter pleaſure than otherwiſe; for why, it poſſeſſes the heart with joy, and a joyfull heart
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:44773:111"/> takes pleaſure in all things.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Thus Love doth alwaies fill</l>
                        <l>Our mindes with bliſſe, that ſtill</l>
                        <l>What ere we thinke or doe,</l>
                        <l>It will delight us; So</l>
                        <l>Whether we ſtudy, work, or play,</l>
                        <l>True love will turne all into joy.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Further, concerning the <hi>Effects</hi> of Love, he can tell her that a Million of other joyfull effects ſpring from true love, which will now be too long to diſcourſe of. Therefore now only, that true love hath ſuch a vertue in it as it will (ſaith one) even turne water into wine. I had rather (ſaith he) drinke water with thee, than wine with another, live meanly with thee, than richly with another. Yea, hee tells her that true love will turne even ſorrow it ſelfe to the encreaſe of its joyes; ſaying further, All the croſſes that ever thee and I have had, I hope we ſhall hereafter quite bury or drown them in the fountaine of our Love-delights, or rather make them ſerve as fuell to encreaſe the flame of our love
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:44773:111"/> and happineſſe; for love and joy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter croſſes paſt is the ſweeter, and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, as having been purified, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and quickned by the ſame. And ſo for future time
<q>
                           <l>When croſſes happen in our way,</l>
                           <l>Weele turne them in our love and joy,</l>
                           <l>And make them ſerve but to enflame,</l>
                           <l>Enlighten, and encreaſe the ſame.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Or by Additions, Appendances, and Circumſtances; as for example, That Love is more ſplendent and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent when it is ſeated in its Throne, and attended with riches, honours, and other pleaſures which ſeeme to be Loves handmaids, who as a Queene, graces all the reſt, and addes glory, ſweetneſſe, and delight to them all. And as a Circumſtance he can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe almoſt of any thing, and ſet forth the excellency thereof, as hath been ſhewed by the attendants, riches, honour, and pleaſures, by the object, Women, by the Parts and Parties af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, which are the moſt excellent parts of man, and commonly the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:44773:112"/> braveſt, nobleſt, moſt generous, and ingenuous men. Alſo by the author, which is God himſelfe, for Love is a daughter of heaven, yea as ſome ſay, a little heaven upon earth; by which alſo (as is to bee ſhewed in the laſt Section hereof) we may ſpie and ſpell glimpſes of heaven, and be the more enflamed (with divine and heavenly love) to ſeeke, and poſſeſſe it. So as it ſeemes we may enjoy two heavens.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>In ſweeteſt joyes that be,</l>
                        <l>My deareſt Love, then we</l>
                        <l>May paſſe our time away</l>
                        <l>All times by night and day:</l>
                        <l>What pleaſure is on earth, (I pray)</l>
                        <l>Or heaven, that we may not enjoy?</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>Thus have I given a taſte of Loves excellency by way of inſtance in this Art of diſcourſe. But I pray remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, it is but by way of diſcourſe, and then I hope you will pardon what is amiſſe, for you know that men will talke ſomewhat largely to pleaſe their Lovers, and yet ſay they have given but a taſte, when they have done. Now
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44773:112"/> I proceed and ſhew further the uſe of this Art of diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>By this Order, or Art, we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of any other particular what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, as for example, of the contrary to that which hath been dilated, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the miſeries of Loves loſſe, which may even readily be dilated and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by this Art, in this manner likewiſe; Either by the Number of miſeries, the miſery of each Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of that Number, with Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in reſpect of Matter, Time, Place, and other occaſions; and each Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular demonſtrated by divers Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Reaſons, Arguments, Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, Contrarieties, Similitudes, Effects, Appendances, Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or otherwiſe; and ſet forth by apt expreſſions, and particularly applyed, and paſſionately enforced and uttered, according to the nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                     <p>In this manner alſo we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of any other ſubject upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, whether of riches, of honour,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:44773:113"/> of health, of prudence, temperance, fortitude, or of any vertue; or of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, diſgrace, ſickneſſe, of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, ambition, intemperance, or of any other vice or miſery; yea, or of Religion and divine matters; and in truth there cannot be a better way even of Love diſcourſing, than a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious way, (however ſeldome practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but rather deſpiſed by many of Blades and gallant Dames of the world, as well as of the fooliſh and blockiſh ſort of people, who thinke and eſteeme all things above their vaine and phantaſticke humours, to be folly and madneſſe; But indeed) what better way of Love diſcourſing can be, than a laudable and pious inſinuation into the minde of ſuch as we diſcourſe with (whether Friend or Lover) by heavenly diſcourſes, which alſo may be done by ſome ſuch like Art as hath been dilated; inſomuch, that if both parties be of a divine temper, their hearts may bee filled, poſſeſſed, and united with heavenly and glorious
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:44773:113"/> thoughts, joy, and love. But theſe things I know will ſeeme folly, myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, ſtrange, and as very riddles to ſuch whoſe meere naturall mindes are not raiſed to the knowledge of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and heavenly things. But ſuch lovers, and friends, whoſe minds are elevated to a ſupernaturall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine temper, their hearts can be filled with heavenly joy in ſuch diſcourſes, and by the eye of Contemplation they can ſee one another (in reſpect of their heavenly mindes) like Angels, divine creatures, and ſo love one another with an heavenly as well as earthly love. Both which being united, doe binde their hearts together with an indiſſoluble knot, and fill them with ſweet ſtreames and fountaines, both of terreſtriall, and of heavenly joyes, and delights.</p>
                     <p>Now to proceed, and give a taſte (as I ſaid) how to attaine to be a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Artiſt in this, or the like art of diſcourſe. Which becauſe it may be ſaid in generall, almoſt in as few
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:44773:114"/> words as particularly of Love, I ſhall endeavour very briefly to ſhew the ſame in a generall way: which is, Firſt, by often and ſerious meditation to imprint into our mindes, the grounds and heads thereof, As Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Particulars, Obſervations, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, Examples, Compariſons, Contrarieties, Similitudes, Effects, Appendances, Circumſtances, and the like, as perfectly as we doe our A, B, C. whereby we may as readily call to minde thoſe grounds, as wee can letters to ſpell words with, which is as faſt as we can ſpeake. Or as in the Art of Brachigraphy, or ſhort-writing, wee readily know at which end, ſide, or place of the letter to ſet the tittle, daſh, or enſuing letter, whereby we know what Vowell, Dipthong, or Word it ſignifies, even as ſuddenly as we can thinke of any thing; Or as Preachers doe eſpecially take notice, and imprint into their mindes, the heads, diviſions, and grounds of their Sermons.</p>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:44773:114"/>
                     <p>Secondly, having thus imprinted the grounds in our mindes, we ought to be furniſhed with ſufficient learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and skill concerning the matter of our diſcourſe: (In generall, to bee skilfull in ſuch Arts and Sciences as we ſhall have moſt occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, whether of Divinity, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, Law, Philoſophy, Hiſtory, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, or other; ſo as I might inſtance alſo in this Art concerning the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, the Lawyer, the Phyſitian, the Gentleman, and divers others as well as the Lover, in their ſeverall waies of diſcourſing, and alſo concerning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers uſuall occaſions, if my skill would attaine thereunto; but this Treatiſe will not admit thereof,) that ſo by obſervation, reading, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we might be furniſhed with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient learning, matter, examples, and skill to this purpoſe, in ſuch ſort that we may (as ſome ancient and well furniſhed Orators, Lawyers, Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and others can in their ſeverall waies) readily diſcourſe (even <hi>Raptim</hi>)
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:44773:115"/> upon any Maxime, Ground, or Rule in their Sciences.</p>
                     <p>So then, impreſſing the grounds of this Art in our mindes, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves with a ready ability to diſcourſe upon theſe grounds, is the way to attain to this Art of diſcourſe. And although the perfection thereof be very difficult to attaine unto in ſuch a ready manner; yet even the meere obſervation or reading thereof, may lend us ſome light, and in this matter of Love be an occaſion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the ſame, and of poſſeſſing our ſelves and Lovers with very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing joyes and delights.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the Art of diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Yet now me thinkes I cannot but imagine that ſome too ſevere <hi>Cato,</hi> churliſh <hi>Timon,</hi> or carping <hi>Momus,</hi> will eſteeme this Love-diſcourſe too light and wanton; for I know there be many in our times ſo Stoicall, and rigid, as they will ſcarce allow lawfull, moderate, convenient, or neceſſary
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:44773:115"/> recreations, (for this diſcourſe was chiefly written for meere tecreation, amidſt more ſerious occaſions, and ſo I deſire it may be read) and that they eſteeme honeſt and harmeleſſe Love-delights, and diſcourſes (though in the way of marriage) Prophaneneſſe.</p>
                     <p>But ſurely piety and vertue is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo rugged, nor auſtere as ſome men would make the ſame; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their rigidneſſe make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, and therein unjuſt to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet certainly in thoſe things which are free from impugning the Lawes of God and humanity, we may at convenient times allow our ſelves honeſt ſolaces and recreations, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſuch a neceſſary good, ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Lawes of God and man, of Nature and neceſſity, of the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankinde. And we may know that it is good and commendable for ſuch as doe, or intend to live in that honourable and bleſſed ſtate of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to be poſſeſt with Conjugall love, and ſo good, that ſuch men are
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:44773:116"/> councelled in the ſacred Book of God, to love their wives as their owne ſelves, yea, as Chriſt loved his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. And this Love is not only a remedy againſt a multitude of irkſome troubles, evils, and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but an occaſion of very many bleſſings, and very much happineſſe indeed (as hath been ſhewed) and therefore conſequently ſuch honeſt harmleſſe Love-diſcourſes, devices, and pleaſures as increaſe ſuch love and happineſſe, are to be eſteemed good and commendable. And I conceive that no well conditioned happy man, none but envious, malitious, malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirits, or elſe ignorant, ſtupid, ſottiſh people, who are not capable of the excellency and felicities of ſuch true, heroical love, will hinder, diſlike, or grudge true Lovers of ſuch honeſt, harmleſſe, and commendable Love-delights and pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>And I am not ſo Cynicall (as one ſaith of himſelfe) but that I thinke a modeſt expreſſion of ſuch amorous,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:44773:116"/> pleaſing conceits and fancies as are free from obſcenity, and ſute with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and goodneſſe, will yet very well become my yeares, in which not to be in a good and convenient manner ſenſible of Love, were as great an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of much ſtupidity, and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſſe, as an over-ſottiſh and doting affection were of extreame folly. But what need I excuſe my ſelfe in this, when it is well knowne, that many whole Volumes have been written of Love. And that divers famous and worthy Philoſophers, Phyſitians, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Poets, and others have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as lightly, and more wantonly than I have done of this ſubject, and yet been highly commended for the ſame, and I thinke in divers reſpects they have done much good thereby, encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing true love and happineſſe in very many that have read their bookes and writings.</p>
                     <p>Yea, ſince (as before I ſhewed) that God himſelf is the author of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall, or marriage love, and doth in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:44773:117"/> the holy Scriptures commend the ſame unto us in a very pleaſing way, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.4, 5, 6. <hi>Marke</hi> 10.7. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. Chapter, and divers other places; and in all that booke of the Song of ſongs, though in a divine way there are very many ſweet and pleaſant expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of love and the delights thereof, and that in a Song or Poem. If then ſuch pleaſing expreſſions may, and is good to be uſed in ſuch a divine way, certainly it may and is alſo in this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane way of lawfull love, without all exceptions, but only by ſuch as are either malitious, or too ſevere, rigid, over-nice, and therein unwiſe men.</p>
                     <p>But ſince good things (yea even the beſt things) may be perverted and abuſed; as Meat to Gluttony, Wine to Ebriety, Riches and honour to the increaſe of all vices, ſo Love to Luſt; I deſire and pray you, Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as you will anſwer to God, that you will not ſo abuſe (as to apply and pervert) any of this Love-diſcourſe to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:44773:117"/> the provoking of unlawfull luſts, but only to good purpoſes, as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of lawfull and convenient mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and the honeſt, harmleſſe, and laudable joyes, delights, and felicities thereof; And ſo I hope, and doubt not but this diſcourſe will doe ſome good, and be well pleaſing to God and good men.</p>
                     <p>But yet perchance my Grandſire may ſay, It ſeemes to him that ſuch light, vaine diſcourſes are of little power or perſwaſion to increaſe love and happineſſe; yet if we thinke of the Parties by, and to whom theſe things are ſpoken, that is, Lovers; who are a great deale more vaine, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, youthfull, and not of ſuch ſerious and ſollid ſubſtance as my Grandſire is; we ſhall know that ſuch diſcourſes are moſt apt and pleaſing, and much more perſwaſive for this purpoſe to increaſe love and joy, then other more grave and ſollid. And we know that Lovers eſteem every word of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers diſcourſe (though perchance but
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:44773:118"/> ſlight matter) as if it were ſpoke like an Angel. And yet truly there is (I wiſh my Grandſire may ſee it) a great deale of ſeriouſneſſe mingled in this Love-diſcourſe, and ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the greateſt, choyceſt, and ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt happineſſe of our lives; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as indeed ſuch artificiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, ſuch pleaſant convincing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions and reaſons are moſt juſtly, really, and ſeriouſly ſufficient, even to inchant and inflame a wiſe one, a Saint with true Love and Ioy; and ſurely the wiſeſt and beſt Saint cannot be too loving and joyfull in this bleſſed and honourable way of conjugall, or marriage Love, no, not joyfull and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough herein; if you will not beleeve this, See againe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 5.25, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I know you will or muſt beleeve that.</p>
                     <p>To returne. I know that ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes will ſo increaſe Love and Joy in true Lovers, that if there be a reaſonable ſympathy betweene the parties in age, degree, fortunes, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:44773:118"/> Conſtitution and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and a willing conſent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Friends at firſt (though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards great and ſtrange oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould happen in many reſpects) it would be a marvellous hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (if not almoſt impoſſible) to part and diſunite their Love.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch diſcourſes then be of ſo ſtrong effect and operation, as to joyne hearts in true love, and increaſe it's Joyes, notwithſtanding many croſſes and great oppoſition, much more is it when thoſe are paſt, when both parties and their friends are well pleaſed, when all their thoughts are compoſed of Kindneſſe, Love and Joy. <hi>Medea's</hi> Oyntment, <hi>Helen's</hi> Bowle, <hi>Circes</hi> Cup, <hi>Phaedra's</hi> Ring, <hi>Venus</hi> Girdle, or <hi>Gyges</hi> Gloves cannot ſo ſweetly inchant, move and pleaſe the minde, ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſe Love and Joy, as ſuch diſcourſes will (and with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may) in Lovers.</p>

                  <p>Though we Batchelours perchance may thinke wives fine things, yet ſuch as have tryed will tell us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as that there are many thornes amidſt the Roſes of Marriage, which hinder the pleaſures thereof, and cauſe much ſorrow.

That the love of the body is at the higheſt, and will fall when it hath gotten admittance into the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and worſt parts thereof, and that ſo it is of the minde: though our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhew us their beſt conditions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44773:121"/> mans ſoule is of a future nature, as well as preſent: It can ſee things to come alſo, as if they were preſent. If then you have a wiſe mans eyes in your ſoule, and can but ſee (yea, if you will but imagine or ſuppoſe that you ſee) the faireſt, lovelieſt, and choiſeſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as they ſhall be, when they are ſick, olde, withered, dead, rotten in their graves, the ſame will appeare ſo ugly, gaſtly, terrible, dreadfull, as you will be ſo far out of love, as rather to loath and ſhun them. Yea, if thou couldſt but ſee what they are now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, that is, but earth, a meere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement which thou ſo admireſt, thy ſoule would be at reſt. Imagine her skin from her face, or other parts of her body. There is nothing within but filthy Phlegme, Choller, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Blood, Gall, Spittle, Snevill, Snot, and other ſtinking, putrid, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementall, loathſome ſtuffe. If you thinke I ſpeake unſeemly; in this caſe it is a good deed and neceſſary, for it is a remedy againſt Love. I hope
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44773:121"/> (young man) you are now wiſer than to grieve and pine away for Love.</p>
                  <p>Now come we to view the minde of women, and ſee whether wee can finde remedy enough in conſideration of their common ill conditions, to make even a pining Lover out of love with them. They are many of them commonly noted to be proud, idle, ſluts, ſcolds, jealous, ſcornfull, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and ſo imperious not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; light, peeviſh, froward, ſad, lumpiſh, prodigall, diſcontented, &amp; of divers other ill conditions. Yet I muſt confeſſe I take this upon truſt, upon other mens words, I write only what I reade, and heare them ſay of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for my owne part I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, for ought I can ſee or finde, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are as good, and in ſome reſpects better than men, as modeſt, loving, kinde, frugall, temperate, conſtant, and the like vertues. But I am but one man, and one or a few ſwallows makes no Summer, as the Proverbe goes; Other men have ſaid, and it ſeemes
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:44773:122"/> found otherwiſe. King <hi>Solomon</hi> it ſeemes could not finde one good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among a thouſand, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.28. And he makes it a queſtion; Who can finde a vertuous woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 31.10. A good woman is a rare thing on the earth, hardly to be found, it ſeemes as Rubies, &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and ſo perchance are good husbands too, for I will confeſſe now I am in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, whether it be true or falſe, that for ought I know, men are as bad, or worſe then women. So that what can we expect among married people, but (what we often may ſee) brawling, vexing, grieving, and diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It is a kinde of Purgatory to tye a mans ſelf to the vaine humours, inconſtancy, peeviſhneſſe, jealouſie, malice, frowardneſſe, lumpiſhneſſe, rage, brawling, ſcolding, craving, evill deſires, obſtinacy, and bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a woman. The wiſe man ſaith, It is better to dwell in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a houſe top, or in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than with a brawling, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:44773:122"/> angry woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.9.19. He had rather dwell with a Lion, and a Dragon, than keep houſe with an evill woman, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 25.16. Shee cauſeth her husband to ſigh bitterly, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. She abateth the courage, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a heavy countenance, a wounded heart, weake hands, and feeble knees, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. She is more bitter than death, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.26.</p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable that many men are commonly more ſullen, dull, ſad, and penſive after marriage than they were before. Wee ſee married men ſeldome goe without care, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and heavineſſe, as if they were in feare, or diſcontented, and many of them after marriage looke like the pourtraicture of misfortune. And yet theſe men before they were marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thought a wife a fine thing, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined a Paradiſe in gaining her. But when a man hath got a wife, it is very like he findes but Copper inſtead of Gold, a Snake inſtead of Fiſh, or if a Fiſh, an Eele by the taile; a wanton
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44773:123"/> 
                     <hi>Venus,</hi> a luſtfull <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> a whoriſh <hi>Thais,</hi> or a ſcolding <hi>Zantippe,</hi> a braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Iuno,</hi> or elſe <hi>Pigmalions</hi> Image, a very Picture, a ſilken-feathered gooſe, a faire Coxecomb, a very bable, one that muſt be humoured in every toy, and trifle, or elſe it will poute and brawle. So that by ſuch a marriage, he gets Nettles inſtead of Roſes, a chiding as bad as halfe a hanging eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, alſo Curtaine (and perchance Curtezan) Sermons, Juniper, and bowlſter Lectures every night. And ſo inſtead of a hoped Paradiſe, hee findes a reall Purgatory. He hath loſt his liberty, and is in as bad a caſe as a Bird in a Limebuſh, or a Mouſe in a Trap.</p>
                  <p>Many men have been undone, and ruined by their wives. A great many ſad examples may be produced of the evils that have happened to men by women, but this would be too long to recite, and there is matter enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides for this purpoſe to remedy pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love. Wee may reade in divers
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44773:123"/> Philoſophers, and other Authors of many wiſe, witty, and merry ſpeeches, opinions, and ſtories againſt marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Since they are commonly known, I ſhall inſtance, and give a taſte but in ſome few of them. One ſaith, that ſince women were made of the rib of a man, which is a crooked thing, they have ever been of very crooked condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That they brooke their name Woman, a woe to man. That God made them for a help to man, and they help indeed to waſte his goods, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his trouble, care, ſorrow, &amp;c. Another ſaith, that during the time of ones mariage there are but two good daies, namely, the marriage day, and the day of the wives death. A third, that he who wants trouble, ſhould get to be a Maſter of a Ship, or marry a wife. Another, that evill yeares, and wives never faile. Another, that if a man would ſee a perfect and well agreeing marriage, the husband muſt be deafe, and the wife blinde, that hee may not heare his wives brawling,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:44773:124"/> nor ſhe ſee her husbands faults. Again, of him that ſaid, before forty yeare old it was too ſoone to marry, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too late. And another, that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have but two faults, that is, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to ſay ill, and doe ill. They tell us alſo of an old Proverb, That a good Wife, a good Mule, and a good Goat are three naughty beaſts. And of him that ſaid, all the time he was unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, which was thirty yeares, ſeemed to him but as thirty daies, but the ſixe yeares ſince he was married, ſeemed to him ſixe hundred yeares, they were ſo tedious. Of him alſo, who when his friend wiſhed him not to marry his ſon ſo young, but to ſtay till he were wiſe, anſwered, not ſo, for if he once grow wiſe he will never marry. And of another that next day after his wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a fine, young, rich wife, being rebuked by his friends for being ſo ſad and melancholy, ſhewed them his foote, ſaying, you ſee this fine new Shooe, but you know not where it wrings me. They forget not alſo to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:44773:124"/> tell of <hi>Iobs</hi> wife, that notwithſtanding he had ſo many afflictions, yet that he had one worſe plague than all the reſt, he had a wife, and that the devill left her to vexe him, and to tempt him to offend God. They tell us alſo of him, who ſeeing his wife fall into a ſwift running River, ſought her up the ſtreame, ſaying, ſhe alwaies uſed to goe againſt the ſtreame of reaſon and goodneſſe. And they tell of him alſo, who being with his wife at Sea, in a ſtorme, when the Maſter of the Ship willed that all ponderous troubleſome things ſhould be throwne over-board, he tooke his wife, and threw her over into the Sea. And of a man whoſe neighbours wife having hanged her ſelfe in a Fig tree, he wiſhed, Oh that he had a tree in his Garden would beare ſuch fruit. And of another, whoſe wife being lately dead, one of her friends chanced to ſay to him that ſhe hoped his wife was in heaven; Is ſhe ſo (ſaid her husband) then I hope I ſhall never come there, for I
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:44773:125"/> would be very loath to be troubled with her againe. Theſe things, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they tell us Comically, and in Jeſt, and ſo I hope you are wiſe enough to reade them.</p>
                  <p>But in good earneſt againe, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is ſaid to be a Rocke, on which many men caſt themſelves away, alſo a Yoke, and a bondage, a multitude of hinderances, charges, cares, croſſes, and annoiances are incident to marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people. What wiſe man would marry?</p>
                  <p>Some men are Cornuted, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Children which are none of their owne. To many men their children prove undutifull, diſobedient, arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, prodigall, and become bitter Croſſes to their Parents; as <hi>Ham</hi> to <hi>Noah, Abſolon</hi> to <hi>David, Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> to old <hi>Eli.</hi> Of moderne Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to this purpoſe, there are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. If I ſhould reckon up all the troubles, vexations, cares, charges, hinderances, and miſeries belonging to marriage, I ſhould be very much
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:44773:125"/> too long and tedious.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I might (for this purpoſe) tell how happily Batchelours live without wives; how freely, ſecurely, merrily, pleaſantly, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule.</p>
                  <p>There are yet further more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and ſublime remedies, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and conſolations to eaſe and cheare the ſoule of a diſcontented and pining Lover. As to conſider that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and very many wiſe men, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divines, Philoſophers, and others, prefer a ſingle life before marriage, I hope you will beleeve them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that marriage corrupts many great and good ſpirits, hinders many good and worthy actions and enterpriſes.</p>
                  <p>I have married a wife (ſaith one) and therefore I cannot come. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.20.</p>
                  <p>Alſo to conſider that it is fitteſt for ſuch to marry who are of lower minds, ſuch as have the moſt groſſe ſpirits, more of earth than heaven in them; tye ſuch men to women, to the fleſh,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:44773:126"/> to mundane troubles, cares, diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. Let the other be free and happy.</p>
                  <p>Alſo to contemne, and even ſcoffe at <hi>Cupid</hi> and all his wooden darts, like that young man, who could merrily ſing
<q>
                        <l>Sir, Cupid is blinde I ſay,</l>
                        <l>Though ſome have thought he ſeeth;</l>
                        <l>And though he hit my heart one day,</l>
                        <l>A T — in Cupids teeth.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>So to endeavour to be Cupids Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to uſe him as we liſt; and if we chance to play with him a little ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for recreation (as wiſe men doe with a foole, or Ladies with a little dog) yet let us alſo ſcoffe at, contemn, and deſpiſe him when we pleaſe and ſee good occaſion.</p>
                  <p>But now concerning that which is the beſt and moſt glorious remedy and conſolation, not onely againſt pining Love, but againſt all other mundane deſires, wants, loſſes, and croſſes; which is to endeavour ſo to be poſſeſſed and inflamed with divine love of God
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:44773:126"/> and heavenly joy in him, and ſo to truſt in his never fayling providence, as to be moſt ſweetly contented and pleaſed at heavens will and pleaſure, to rejoice even in loſſes and croſſes, and thinke them divine love-tokens, as certainely they are to them who love him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. He that loves God better than himſelfe, cannot but be ſweetly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with his will in all things. So let us endeavour to love him above our ſelves, and ſo to be pleaſed with his pleaſure, as to ſay, yea, Vow to God &amp; men to this purpoſe (if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) as I doe now, That ſince 'tis Gods will, I wiſh no other happineſſe then what I doe enjoy, but all things to be as they are ſince he thinks good. Me thinks I neither dare nor can wiſh greater happineſſe then to know that God (whom I would love infinitely above my ſelfe) is infinitely happy. Let us then endeavour to be of ſuch an heavenly temper, ſo enlightened with divine Love and Joyes, as to have little or no roome left in our
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44773:127"/> ſoules for carnall, groſſer love and joyes, while we are elevated in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoughts and contemplations; for certainly thoſe ſpirits, which are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed to the knowledge of divine things, and doe well know the Art of heavenly contemplations, are elevated above all the love and pleaſures of the earth, inaſmuch as eternall heavenly felicities, are above humane, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, earthly vanities, and not finding any thing on earth worthy of their love and deſires, they doe note and ſet out their deſires, their pleaſures, and felicities in heaven: So as they doe in part beforehand taſte of the ſweetneſſe of thoſe delights, which they pretend to receive at the end of their life, which makes them very graciouſly to ſet under their feet all the Love and pleaſures of the earth, while their ſoules are in ſuch contemplations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting their aimes to heaven. And while they are in theſe divine extaſies, their ſpirits are ſo ſtrong, as they doe overcome their carnall deſires, ſo hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44773:127"/> as they doe then eſteeme the greateſt pleaſures of the body (as this of carnall Love) but as dung and droſſe in compariſon of the heavenly Love and pleaſures which they enjoy in their ſoules. And in ſuch contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and compariſon, they rejoyce more in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>contemning this earthly love and pleaſures, then in enjoying the ſame. What need wee care for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, who may have gold enough? for earthly, that may have heavenly happineſſe?</p>
                  <p>But as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſignifies, Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age hinders this divine Love and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly pleaſures. He that is married (ſaith he) careth for the things of the world, how he may pleaſe his wife. But he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32. &amp;c. One doubted not to ſay, that if men could live without deſiring women and other ſuperfluous things of the world, they would be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited and very familiarly accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Angels. And certainely,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:44773:128"/> there bee many married men in the world, if they did but truly know the excellency of ſuch a contemplative heavenly life, and did ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how freely and joyfully Batche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors may live, they would even runne through fire and water to be ſo happy.</p>
                  <p>But now leſt married men ſhould be too much diſpleaſed, with what I have written, Let me tell them, I write this chiefly to comfort, eaſe and cheere the hearts of diſcontented, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, pining, languiſhing Lovers: And herein I thinke I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to doe a very good deed, and to ſhew very good cauſes and reaſon enough to cheere, comfort, and rejoice the moſt ſad, drooping, languiſhing, and diſcontented Lover, if he be not gone out of his ſenſes or without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And let thoſe diſpleaſed married men (if any be ſo) know or thinke, that when we ſpeake againſt Marriage, wee meane onely of unfit and evill marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages: Such as that of <hi>Spungius</hi> and <hi>Philtra.</hi> They would quarrell, ſweare,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:44773:128"/> curſe, fight, &amp;c. Let ſuch be alwayes ſcoft at, and remaine miſerable, till they mend their manners.</p>
                  <p>And leaſt Batchelours ſhould bee too averſe from Marriage, and ſuch as loſe their firſt Love ſhould forbeare a ſecond choyce, which alwayes drowns the love of the former in oblivion, and is one of the beſt Remedies againſt Loves loſſe, for heere they finde it againe in another; Let us ſtill ſay (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) That marriage is honourable in all men, and that it is good to marry, though better to live ſingle. And that a Conſonant, equall, and fit marriage when both parties bee loving, kinde, wiſe, conſtant, and of good conditions, is even a Terreſtriall Paradiſe, and from thence as hath been dilated, proceedeth a marvellous deale of happy bleſſed effects.</p>
                  <p>But me thinkes I cannot yet leave this ſubject of the vanity, frailty, folly, and miſeries of Love, (I meane now only of an overſottiſh &amp; doting Love) it is ſo neceſſary. For ſeeing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44773:129"/> of lawful Love, and the many ſweet and bleſſed effects ſpringing from thence, it is great reaſon to take heed, that we doe not (as many men in the world have done) plunge our ſelves beyond the Boundmarkes of Reaſon and Diſcretion, into an over-ſottiſh and doting affection.</p>
                  <p>Oh, how ſtrange, and what pitty it is to thinke, how many, otherwiſe moſt famous, wiſe, and beſt of men, have beene ſo bewitched and beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this over-doting Love, (though but for a time, and after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented) in ſo much as they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome Crimes, and many groſſe dotages for Love, as we may read of <hi>Iacob, Ruben, Iudah, Sampſon, David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> (to omit the more unwotthy ones) in the ſacred Scriptures. To reade and conſider alſo of <hi>Caeſar, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niball, Theſeus, Achilles, Pompey, Marke Anthony, Troylus, Hercules,</hi> and many other famous, great and noble ſpirits, alſo of <hi>Socrates</hi> himſelfe, and many of the wiſeſt Philoſophers, and many
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44773:129"/> Worthies in all Ages; What mad, fooliſh, and ſtrange prankes, practiſes, and dotages, they have acted for Love? Alſo to heare the Poets tell of men that degenerate into Dogs, Hogs, Aſſes, Bruites, for Love; as <hi>Lycaon</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wolfe; <hi>Caliſta,</hi> a Beare, <hi>Elpenor</hi> and <hi>Grillus</hi> into Swine by <hi>Circe, Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus</hi> into an Aſſe, yea, <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe for <hi>Europa, Laeda,</hi> and others into a Bull, a Swan, a golden Showre, a Satyr, a Shepheard, for Love; expreſſing by their Morals, how men by their foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh over-fond Love and Luſts make Beaſts and Bruits of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>How can we but ſtrangely wonder to conſider that ſo many thouſand men created after Gods owne Image, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obled with ſuch an excellent ſoule, ſhould be ſo beſotted with this over-fond and doting Love, as that they doe even ſtrive by all meanes more to pleaſe their Lovers then God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and all the world beſides; and ſo neglect the love of that infinitely to be beloved, and Glorious, Amiable,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:44773:130"/> and loving God, for the love of ſo fraile and vaine a creature. Yea, and even to worſhip and Idolatrize to her. So as they deſire, thinke of, dream of, delight in nothing more, &amp; almoſt nothing elſe but her, though millions of choyſeſt delights, and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities both earthly and heavenly preſent themſelves to their enjoyment if they had wit and grace enough to enjoy the ſame. Yet they very foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly neglect all theſe, and place all their felicity in this weake, fraile, vaine creature.</p>
                  <p>She muſt be as they ſay, their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe forſooth, their life, their ſoule, their Angell, their Paradiſe, their Goddeſſe (indeed rather their Idoll) their every thing. Their mouthes, hearts, eyes, eares, thoughts are never well but when they are full of her. As he that is bit with a mad Dog, thinkes all he ſees is Dogs, ſo this fooliſh, fond, mad Lover, thinkes, ſayes, and wiſhes, to heare and ſee almoſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but her; and without her
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44773:130"/> he is even all amort, and as melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Cat. They are even as mad of love as if they had eaten Hemlockes, and wanted Helebore, and in this mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſo blinded they are, and deluded, as to thinke their Miſtreſſes the moſt beautifull, lovely, ſweet, amiable, neat, fine, witty, wiſe, and the onely Paragon of their Sexe, when in the eyes of others that are not ſo mad, blinde, and deluded, there is no ſuch matter, but rather they ſee them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps very homely, however vaine, fraile, and perchance unworthy things. And yet theſe brainſicke, Inamoratoes, will ſay and thinke for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth that they are ſweeter than all the ſeverall or compounded flowers, and perfumes; fairer and brighter than Lillies, Ivory, Glaſſe, Silver, Gold, Pearles, Stars, Moone, Sunne, Angels, yea, even as heaven it ſelfe.

                  <p>He is perhaps ſo ſottiſh, or braine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, as not to be capable of ſuch an heroicall, quickning, and delightfull temper as true love; yet it is like he can be fooliſhly fond, talke baudily, and doe worſe then he talkes; but leaving <hi>Momus</hi> againe to his carping, fretting, pining, folly, I returne and proceed. The truth is, that lawfull true love is good and commendable, and it is only an over-fond, unfit, or undue Love that I write againſt in this Section. We may plainly ſee the difference if we be wiſe; for from the one proceedeth (as hath been ſaid) a multitude of good, bleſſed, pleaſant and happy effects, and from the other (as hath alſo been ſhewed) commeth a multitude of evils, ſorrows, ſtrange dotages, and miſeries. Inſomuch as me thinkes I could willingly againe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44773:132"/> write of the vanity and folly of this over-ſottiſh and fond love, though I have been ſo long already. It is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement paſſion and perturbation of the minde, a monſter of nature, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyer of wit and art. It often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaves men of manlineſſe of ſpirit, and of divine Graces; and makes them ſometimes to fall in love even with painted vanities, meere outſide creatures, things empty of goodneſſe, and compoſed of pride, folly, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>If we love ſuch as have no other beauties but their bodies, what do we but love as irrationall creatures doe; Reaſon tels us we love that which the ſcratch of a pin may deface, that which ſome Phyſitians ſay, is ſubject to above three hundred common diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that which a ſhort time ſpoiles and disfigures. That which is all loathſome within, and that which ſhall be hereafter nothing but putrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and rotten corruption. Where is now the faire <hi>Helena, Cleopatra, Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſa,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44773:133"/> Hero, Lucretia, Irene, Lais, Creſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, Laurea, Corinna, Roxane, Panthea, Leucippe, Ariadne, Polyxena, Lesbia, Roſamond,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red pieces whom the world hath ſeemed to adore, where is now their beauty and glory? They are dead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſinke of corruption, and ſo gaſtly as you would be afraid to looke upon them. Thinke now you proud dames, what Mettle you are made of, and let it give a checke to your Pride.</p>
                  <p>Flatter not your ſelves before your glaſſe, you miſtreſſes, and madames of the world, I meane you, who are empty and void of grace, and full of pride and wickedneſſe, you that take a pride to ſubject and charme divers ſpirits, and to bereave them of reaſon and grace; you that ſtudy each day new leſſons of vanity, pride, and niceneſſe, to wound hearts whereby you undoe foules: Your body is juſt of the ſame temper with the ſhadow which you ſee in your glaſſe, you are even as nothing. Or if you will that I ſay you are ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44773:133"/> you are a meere dunghill cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſnow, a ſinke of infection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with flowers, a rich coffer full of lothſomneſſe; you are the frayleſt and moſt changeable things in the world; I dare hardly eye you any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for feare while I looke upon you, you vaniſh from my eyes, ſince you are ready to change, and to dye every houre.</p>
                  <p>Me thinkes I could even laugh at your vanities, and mocke at thoſe that admire you ſo fondly. I could willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne backe, and teare thoſe former Love diſcourſes out of my booke, in contempt of your frailties and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were it not for their ſakes, who are indeed true-lovers. But for ſuch lovers ſakes truly, who are not poſſeſt with this over-fond and doting affection on the one ſide. Nor with a ſtupid, bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, or peeviſh Love on the other ſide, ſuch who are indeed vertuous, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, modeſt, loving, conſtant, of ſweet and gracious conditions: I could wiſh that I were capable to invent ſuch
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44773:134"/> ſweet and pleaſant Love-ſtraines, as might continually fill their hearts with as much joy and delight in each others, as can be thought of. Let us then endeavour to be ſuch True-Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and to all ſuch as to our ſelves, let us wiſh all happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>But once more you doting and over-fond Lovers, harke yee; you that by reaſon of your unuſuall feares, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, ſuſpition, anxiety, dotage, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, melancholy, ſighes, much wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, leane body, pale cheekes, hollow eyes, looke as if you were planet-ſtrucke: I pray thinke ſeriouſly againe, what a fraile peece of earth, vanity, and corruption 'tis that you ſo fooliſhly dote upon, and 'twill make you wiſer, and may ſet your heart and ſoule at quiet, in peace.</p>
                  <p>But now for ſome remedies and conſiderations againſt diſcontents af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marriage. Such men therefore who miſtake themſelves (as many do) thinking they take an Angel by the hand at their marriage day in the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44773:134"/> Church, but after finde they have a Scorpion in their houſe, and in their beds; (for King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, an evill woman is like a Scorpion) So if they ſhould finde and marry ſome ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, brawling, ill conditioned woman, yet let them be contented; Let them be as wiſe as they may; and conſider womens weakneſſes and infirmities; that if perhaps men had their bodies, they would be as fraile and as paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as women. And if women were freed from the frailty of their Sexe, they would be as manly, and excellent as men. And though women have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers naturall infirmities both of body and minde, yet a wiſe man will love his wife not a jot the worſe, becauſe he knowes the ſame are naturall.</p>
                  <p>But few women are Angels, and he that would have a wife without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, muſt marry when the ſigne is not in heaven. And for this ſcolding ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, this is eſteemed a good remedy; To be ſilent and not regard her, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſmile and laugh at her. Alſo
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44773:135"/> let them with wiſe <hi>Socrates,</hi> learne the exerciſes of patience, wiſdome, and many other vertues from their wives maligne conditions.</p>
                  <p>But let men ſee if the fault be not in themſelves. The reaſon why many women are ſo bad, is becauſe they have ill husbands. Some men, as if their wives (like Wallnut trees, and Stockfiſh) were the better for beating, will very unmanly and uncivilly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them, and that perchance when themſelves by reaſon of their ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are juſtly in all the blame. And it is ſtrange to thinke how many croſſes, and diſtempers in marriage many men doe make more than they finde. They are of ſuch croſſe and untoward condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that if they can finde none, yet they will make holes in one anothers coates, and pick faults even out of matters of nothing, and make little faults great by their fooliſh aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to both their griefe and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo living together as two ſnarling dogs in a paire of couples. And by
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44773:135"/> their lewd, luxurious, fooliſh, chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, brawling, indiſcreet, unconſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable carriage to one another, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy no content, but rather griefe in their marriages; ſo making that an earthly hell, which if they were both wiſe and good, might be a terreſtriall Paradiſe. The beſt remedy then for this, is to mend their ill manners, and to endeavour to make one another as good as they can. Happy are they whoſe wives are an occaſion of their being good. And ſometimes a good man may chance to make a good wife of an ill one.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo fit that men ſhould uſe their wives well, and maintaine them in good faſhion, according to their meanes, and to let them have ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and convenient liberty and Authority, as is fit a Wife (who is a mans ſecond ſelfe) ſhould have and enjoy. For want of this, many women being too ſtraitly kept under, unkindly and churliſhly uſed, are even forced to flye out beyond Reaſon to
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44773:136"/> become froward, contentious, jealous, diſcontented; and ſome to turne Queanes even by compulſion.</p>
                  <p>Too much liberty and authority on the other ſide is not fit to bee allow'd them, eſpecially to ſuch kinde of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as love not their owne houſes, but by reaſon of too much gadding abroad learne more tricks then bee good; who are then onely contented and pleaſant; and at home nothing but brawle, and be commonly ſullen, froward, peeviſh, diſcontented, and of idle lewd conditions.</p>
                  <p>Let therefore both men and women endeavour to avoyde all occaſions of ſtrife and diſcontent as much as they may; and ſuch as cannot be avoyded, either to diſſemble or contemne, and to make the beſt uſe thereof. And in all reſpects to endeavour to live lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly familiarly and pleaſantly in ſuch ſort as becomes them.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us excellent dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions! So ought men to love their Wives (ſaith he) as their owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44773:136"/> for no man ever yet hated his owne fleſh, but nouriſheth and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth it, even as the Lord his Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.25. And againe, ye men, love your Wives, and be not bitter unto them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.19. And to women hee ſaith, Wives ſubmit your ſelves unto your Husbands, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, for the Husband is head of the Wife, even as Chriſt is head of the Church, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.22.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo giveth directions to this purpoſe in his firſt Epiſtle and third Chapter. I will write the ſame at large for they are moſt excellent. He begins with Wives, and is longeſt about them, they having as it ſeemes moſt need of Inſtruction. Ye Wives (ſaith he) bee in ſubjection to your owne Husbands, that if any obey not the Word, they alſo may without the Word, be wonne by the converſation of their Wives, while they behold their chaſt converſation coupled with fear, whoſe adorning let it be the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meeke and quiet ſpirit,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44773:137"/> which is in the ſight of God, of great price; for after this manner in the old time the holy women alſo who truſted in God, adorned themſelves, being in ſubjection to their owne huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, even as <hi>Sara</hi> obeyed <hi>Abraham,</hi> calling him Lord, whoſe daughters ye are as long as ye doe well, &amp;c. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ye husbands (ſaith he) dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker veſſell, and as being heires together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be ye of one minde, having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion one of another, be pittifull, be courteous, not rendering evil for evill, or railing for railing, but in contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe bleſſing, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye may inherite a bleſſing. Thus much S. <hi>Peter</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 3. ver. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>So then, let men and their wives in all reſpects endeavour to live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they ought, according to ſuch
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44773:137"/> divine directions. Let them alwaies be familiar, kinde, pleaſant, and as loving as may be, and mutually enjoy together all the bleſſings and benefits belonging to this lawfull conjugall, or marriage love and ſociety.</p>
                  <p>And eſpecially let them be pious and religious; Then though their beauty and bodies ſhould decay and become infirme, yet their very ſoules may be in love with one another, which is far more excellent than bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily love. So while they view one another as divine and celeſtiall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as the beloved of God himſelfe, their loves may ſtill kindle and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, untill both they and it aſcend to that glorious Paradiſe of God, where love (all divine and heavenly) flames beyond imagination, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures beyond time, for ever.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hile we view the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of lawfull and true love, let us alſo beware of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and raging luſts. There is well nigh as much difference (as one ſaith) betweene true love, and unlawfull luſts, as between heaven and hell, for lawfull marriage, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall love is honourable, bleſſed, and ordained of God. A remedy againſt theſe unlawfull luſts. And from this love ſpringeth (as hath been declared) a million of bleſſed and joyfull ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. But all unlawfull luſts and the effects thereof, as fornications, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, inceſts, and the like, are curſed,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44773:138"/> and often forbidden, and threatned againſt in Gods ſacred Word, as all men acquainted therewith doe well know, and from thence proceedeth a multitude of evill and miſerable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>And yet in this age, how ſtrangely doe theſe evils extend themſelves; ſo as it ſeemes it is now as it was in the Prophet <hi>Ieremies</hi> time; The land is full of adulterers. <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.10. It is ſtrange to thinke how many men range after many ſeverall women. They run abroad as beaſts run to rutt, after every Gill and Queane they can meet with, though perchance their owne wives be far more comely, ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and chaſt; yet will they like ſome goatiſh <hi>Procullus,</hi> or luſtfull <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> take all they can get, and never be contented, unleſſe like a common Bull or Boare, they may run and range where they liſt, and would if they could, have more ſeverals than ever <hi>Solomon</hi> or <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> had, or as many as the Turkes, Muſcovits, Zeriffes,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44773:139"/> and Perſians have at this day. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perchance they often loath their owne actions, yet in a while againe they are of another minde, and Stallion-like will againe runne after their Gils and Truls; and ſo though perhaps they may be ſometimes ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet not ſatisfied: <hi>Etna</hi> and <hi>Veſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> will be as ſoone quenched with Oyle, as their raging luſt ſatisfied. They will never bee contented with that One whom they ought to love truly, and enjoy only; but ſo incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and incontinent they are, that within a few Moones after marriage they thinke themſelves cloyed, glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, grow wiſeſick, and perchance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre ſome ill favoured, ill condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, common quean before a good wife. She that before marriage was wooed by many monſtrous ſolicitations, oathes, promiſes, and proteſtations of love, is now undeſervedly diſtaſted, and perchance loathed, (as <hi>Amnon</hi> loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed <hi>Thamar</hi>) or forſaken and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, (as <hi>Demophoon</hi> dealt with
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44773:139"/> 
                     <hi>Phillis</hi>) and ſome idle ſtinking whore reſpected before her, and this perhaps for little or no cauſe or reaſon, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it is the nature and nurture of ſuch beaſts ſo to doe; although they be better in their owne paſtures, yet they will breake over all fences of credit, civility, conſcience, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity for new and other paſtures, and although the ſame prove to them as Rot-graſſe to ſheep, bring them to diſeaſes, undoing, ſhame, and miſery.</p>
                  <p>But eſpecially among idle, young, Taverne, Taphouſe, Tipling compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, their principall diſcourſe tends to the increaſe of theſe unlawfull luſts, as of women and their appurtenances, of Cuckolds and Cuckoldmakers, what men weare hornes, what women britches, and what willing ones there be in the Towne or Pariſh, how ſuch pieces are to be handled, and many ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baldry obſcene diſcourſes, ſongs, tales and jeſts. Of ſuch things is their chief mirth, and their wit is never ſo prompt as here, eſpecially among
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44773:140"/> young men who uſually at their pot-meetings, pervert all occaſions of talk into baudery, and out of all other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, they commonly fall into this, and are moſt taken with it; and this ſets the young gameſter on edge, and if he once get the trick on it, he is very unlike to leave it, untill the poxe, ſhame, or ſome other miſchiefe take him. And in theſe Taverne and Tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe meetings among ſuch compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the intent that wives may bee out of requeſt among them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for other baſe ends, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſſe one another, that change and variety is good: (though indeed it carries away the minde from all goodneſſe and true love, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides and cloies it, that it hinders all true and moſt delightfull pleaſures in love, and is often an occaſion of ſhame and of divers diſeaſes, alwaies of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, repentance, or greater miſchiefs; but theſe things are not talked of, or perhaps ſcoft at, till by wofull experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they finde and feele them.) But
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:44773:140"/> theſe inducements to unlawfull luſts, and whoring, they think are no faults, but fine devices and mirth, while they ſpeake but over the fields, and under the Roſe, as by the names of trickes of youth, playing with Miſtreſſes, graft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of hornes, Cuckoldmaking, and the like fine words which they often uſe and leave out, adultery, whoring, knaving, and ſuch words, as being too plaine, too groſſe, and ſpoiling all the mirth; though yet there be ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, brazen-faced, diſſolute knaves, that over their pots, and among their Companions will even bragge of, and glory in their Whoring and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Let us now briefly view the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuch unlawfull Luſts and Whoring: The ſame often cauſeth to the bodies of many men loathſome diſeaſes, as Pox, Gout, Sciatica, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, Aches, and divers others. It uſually cauſeth dulneſſe and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, Whoredome takes away the heart, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.11. and often ſhortens life</p>

                  <p>From this root of unlawfull Luſts ſpringeth alſo to the ſoule of man a multitude of Evils and Miſeries, ſuch as commonly attend fornications, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries, Inceſts, Rapes, and the like; From hence commeth Cares, Feares, Jealouſies, Perplexities, Enmities, Contention, hatred, heartburnings, Paines, Sadneſſe, Dulneſſe; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fiery dot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:44773:142"/> of Vowes, Treacheries, Duels and murders are hereby occaſioned.

                  <p>Thus it appeares, though theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Luſts may ſeeme to promiſe much, as the Harlot did to the young Man, to take their fill of Love, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.18. Yet this filling proves but emptineſſe, or rather fils the heart full of Evill, Sorrow, and miſery. The ſame brings forth but a Wind-egge, a Moone Calfe, ſome imperfect <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brio,</hi> or Monſtrous Birth; as Shame, Melancholy, Sorrow, Diſeaſes, Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and perchance Ruine both of Body and Soule; for an Whore is a deepe ditch, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.7. and 22.14. And hee that goeth after her, goeth as an Oxe to the ſlaughter, as a Foole to the Stockes, and till a Dart ſtrike through his Liver, &amp;c. <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.22, 23. So though the ſame ſeemeth to be pleaſant as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44773:142"/> Honey and Oyle at firſt, yet the end is bitter as Wormewood, and ſharpe as a two edged Sword, ſaith King <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon, Prov.</hi> 5.4. and her houſe is the way to death and hell, <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 7.27.

The ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſideration of all theſe evils and miſeries may juſtly cauſe men ſpeedily to repent, amend, and for ever greatly hate and endevour to avoyd ſuch unlawfull Luſts.</p>
                  <p>You Courtiers and others who thinke it a trimme peece of glory to get a Miſtreſſe and a Ladies favour forſooth; you, who eſteeme and call your Minions or Whores divine and caeleſtiall names, and would (like <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>) give Paradiſe (if you had it) for an Apple, venture heaven to ſatisfie your baſe and unlawfull Luſts, you that adore theſe Victimes, and thinke
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44773:143"/> your ſelves moſt happy when you can tempt the chaſtity of theſe female creatures and overcome them to your Luſts; what doe you but with <hi>Ixion</hi> embrace a cloude for <hi>Iuno?</hi> What doe you enjoy and adore but a Cruſt full of Corruption, that muſt ſhortly rot and turne to Putrifaction? What a thing is this? a peece of Clay quickned with life adores a Snowy dunghill; but there ſhall come a time when the cruſt of your pleaſures ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and you ſhall ſee what ſhame, griefe, dulneſſe, aches, diſeaſes, evils and miſeries lies within; what have you done but acted the Devils ſtratagems which he hath taught you? Thinke what horror you ſhall ſuffer at the day of judgement, unleſſe you repent and amend.</p>
                  <p>Other Remedies uſually preſcribed againſt theſe unlawfull Luſts are; A moderate, coole, dry, and ſparing diet, faſting, prayer, continuall action in ſome good buſineſſe or imployments, and to be alwayes ſtudying, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44773:143"/> or thinking of other good matters, eſpecially of heavenly things.</p>
                  <p>But one of the beſt and moſt uſuall Remedies for ſuch as are of an unruly temper, is lawfull Conjugall Love and Marriage, for ſuch deſires ſhould be contained in the chaſte breaſt of one Companion onely, and that in the way of Marriage. Who doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, transgreſſes the Lawes of God, of Nature, of Nations, of Families, and of Juſtice. Hee breaketh faith, truſt, and conſtancy, brings in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, jealouſies, diſcontents, and as hath beene ſhew'd, a multitude of evils and miſeries,</p>
                  <p>Let therefore married men endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to love their Wives as much as they can, and let Batchelours, if they may marry ſuch as from their hearts they can truely Love, for true Lovers (as I conceive) may take more pleaſure in the enjoying one another, then if they might poſſeſſe the Love and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of as many Minions and beauties
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44773:144"/> as they can deſire in the world; for why, diverſity of Loves (as in objects to the ſight) hinder intire and true pleaſure in any. And wee know that one dainty diſh moſt pleaſing to our Palate is more delightfull, than abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which cloyes our eyes and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now endeavour briefly to perſwade ſuch as may conveniently (though a ſingle life be otherwiſe to be preferr'd before it) to this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and bleſſed eſtate of Marriage. Marriage (ſaith one) filleth the world with men, and heaven with Saints.</p>
                  <p>It hath alwayes beene confeſt by all reaſonable men, That a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Marriage, (ſuch as when both parties be equally matcht in reſpect of yeres, birth, conſtitution and fortunes, and eſpecially of loving, kinde, wiſe, conſtant, and good conditions, ſuch as live together like <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sarah, Iſaack</hi> and <hi>Rebecca, Petus</hi> and <hi>Aria, Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> and <hi>Paulina, Cato</hi> and <hi>Portia, Rube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Celar</hi> and his <hi>Ennea,</hi> and the reſt of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44773:144"/> thoſe who are recorded as true and happy Lovers) is even an earthly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe of Happineſſe. And no man can juſtly blame ſuch marriages, unto which the Lawes both divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane exhort, Nature provoketh, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty draweth, all Nations approve of, aboundance of felicity inviteth, and neceſſity of continuing mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth. If all men ſhould live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married an hundred yeeres, the world would be unpeopled; and this alone may excuſe and commend ſuch men who like of Marriage better then ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle life, ſince the one turnes to deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other to encreaſing of Mankinde. The Grecians, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans did, and the Spaniards do (in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Marriage) give priviledges thereunto. Marriage is honourable among all men, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Among Chriſtians, Iewes, Turkes, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, (and why not among Fryers and Jeſuites too, if they be men) in praiſe of which ordnance of God and men, the pennes of many Authors in all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44773:145"/> Ages have beene exerciſed (yea of the Papiſts themſelves, who make it a Sacrament, and yet forbid the ſame to their Prieſts.) The beſt &amp; moſt learned Philoſophers have praiſed and uſed the ſame, as <hi>Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Plutarch,</hi> and divers others. Though there be many enemies to the name of marriage, yet few to the uſe of it. He was made imperfect, that is not tending to propagation. He that is perfect and marries not, is ſaid to be guilty of a contempt againſt Nature and Juſtice. And why ſhould any man thinke that God is pleaſed with that rigid inhibition of Marriage among the Papiſts, which croſſeth the current of Nature and his owne ordination. It is the doctrine of Devils, to forbid marriage, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.1, 3. Some thinke the beſt chaſtity is Matrimoniall or Conjugall Chaſtity; when Paires keep themſelves in a moderate intermutuall enjoyance, one conſtant to the other.</p>
                  <p>And though (as hath beene ſaid) a contemplative divine ſpirit can
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44773:145"/> overcome Nature, and contemne the greateſt earthly joy and pleaſure, in compariſon of heavenly delights, and take great pleaſure in ſuch contempt; Yet all men have not this divine grace of Continency. And looking downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards againe, we may conſider that we have bodies as well as ſoules, which require due and convenient recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And though (as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> well obſerved) Marriage hindereth a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly contemplative life, in reſpect of care and other diſturbances; yet, in reſpect of all theſe forenamed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations and many other, it is good to marry, though better to live ſingle, if we burne not, and if we have divine grace enough to live continent. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo findeth a Wife (ſaith King <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſurely he meaneth a good Wife) find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the Lord, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.22.</p>
                  <p>And ſince this Conjugall or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſociety, is ordained and bleſſed of God in Paradiſe in the ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, approved of and commended
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44773:146"/> by Chriſt when he was on earth, and ſince by his Apoſtles and Saints, and is ſaid to be honourable among all men. A remedy againſt fornication, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Luſts, a reſemblance and figure betweene Chriſt and his Church. An uniting of two into one fleſh, and as ſome affirme, into one ſpirit alſo, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the ſpirits of true Lovers doe paſſe one into another, ſo (as Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> adviſeth them and us) they may be of one mind (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.) and ſince it is the ſweeteſt and neareſt relation of Love, friendſhip and ſociety, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and encreaſe of children, families and all Mankinde; it cannot be deni'd, but it is good to marry, eſpecially for ſuch whoſe bodies and mindes doe ſympathize, and who are both of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and good conditions. From ſuch a marriage (as hath beene dilated) ſpringeth the beſt and pleaſanteſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and felicities of this life.</p>
                  <p>To conclude then; let us wiſh all joy to ſuch happy Lovers; Let all the Muſes ſing the moſt delightful ſtrains,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44773:146"/> and all the Graces dance the choyſeſt Rounde layes at their Wedding. Let all pleaſantneſſe, Love and Joy dwell in their hearts. And as their yeares, ſo may their love and joy increaſe, that in after times they may ſay, This is the twentieth or thirtieth yeare of our joy. And let them ſtill take King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> counſell. Rejoyce with the Wife of thy youth, let her be unto thee as the loving Hinde and pleaſant Roe, &amp;c. <hi>Pro.</hi> 5.19.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch men who uſe theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Felicities of the World, (as this of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall or Marriage Love) to the glory of God, and to good ends,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:44773:147"/> with moderate delectation, are better to be reputed, then they who unduly, inconſiderately, raſhly, inconvenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſuperſtitiouſly (as ſome Monks and others doe) neglect and refuſe ſuch a good, which God himſelfe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offers and commends to our accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the rather ſince theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Pleaſures and earthly bleſſings may ſerve to many excellent uſes, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us up to all duties of Piety, to the Love of God, to joy in him, to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and ſo in all reſpects to his praiſe and glory.</p>
                  <p>But the principall good uſe of this Conjugall or Marriage Love, and the felicities thereof, which I ſhall now inſiſt upon, is; That by viewing, and enjoying ſuch pleaſures and felicities of the Earth, we may looke higher to their fountaine, contemplating the Love, Lovelineſſe, Beauty, ſweetneſſe, and excellency of the Creator and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of theſe, who is infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling. And ſo to conclude this diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with this Section of Divine Love,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44773:147"/> a Subject requiring our pureſt and moſt Angelicall attention and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>True it is that all other excellencies are but dung and droſſe in reſpect of God, yet by and through theſe lower Loves, delights, and felicities of the Earth, theſe little glimmering Rayes proceeding from that Sunne of Glory God himſelfe, wee may eſpie ſome light of him, and of that eternall Love, Beauty, Glory, and happineſſe, which we pretend hereafter to enjoy, and ſo in ſome meaſure, ſpell and ſpie Heaven from the Earth. Neither ought wee to diſdaine to make ſuch compariſons between corporeal &amp; ſpiritual things, between Earth y and Heavenly, though in reſpect of the excellency of the ſpirituall and heavenly, there is no compariſon; yet (as children have need at firſt to be allured to the acquiſt of great and excellent matters, by ſuch toyes and trifles as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, ſo) in reſpect of our weak ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion ſuch compariſons and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44773:148"/> ſimilitudes are and ought to be uſed in a convenient manner. So as wee may make a very good uſe of earthly feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, in this reſpect (as men doe of Spectacles) for by and through the good uſe of theſe our dimme eies may ſee the cleerer into heavenly Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, and conſequently be the more enamour'd of them, and ſo ſtirred up to ſeeke and enjoy them. And in this reſpect of Conjugall Love, the ſacred Scripture gives us many and faire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. As in divers places thereof Chriſt and his Church are compared to Lovers betrothed, and to be marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. And the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bride, the Lambes wife, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9. and the end of the world is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Marriage day. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.17. S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> calleth Chriſt the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, &amp; his Chur: the bride, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.29 And Chriſt calleth himſelf the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, <hi>Marke</hi> 3. That ſong of ſongs betweene two Lovers betrothed each to other, is by the conſent of all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines a moſt pleaſant Love-ſong be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and his Church, I might
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44773:148"/> inſtance in many other places.</p>
                  <p>What remaines then, but that from this earthly, we looke up, ſeeke, and enjoy that fountaine and eſſence of all love, lovelineſſe, beauty, ſweetneſſe, and excellency; which is infinitely more loving, lovely, ſweet, excellent, and permanent than all the other beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, delights, and excellencies of the world, if they were all united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If we could truly thinke what God is, how lovely, beautifull, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and in all reſpects infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, our hearts would preſently be filled with love and admiration of him; inſomuch as then we ſhould ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our deareſt thoughts on him; and in his love we ſhould be filled with ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt flames of joy and pleaſures. One thing have I deſired, ſaith King <hi>David,</hi> and I will ſtill deſire, to behold the beauty of the Lord. His beauty infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely excels the beauty and glory of the Sun, Moone, Stars, Angels, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or what is moſt excellent; when therefore we ſee the moſt inchanting
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44773:149"/> beauty, and lovelineſſe the world can ſhew us, let us thinke there is yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more beauty and lovelineſſe in God the Creator, and fountaine of this. Let us endeavour to ſee a kinde of infinitely higher, purer, amiable, divine and heavenly perfection even through the frailty of a face.</p>
                  <p>Who would not gaze himſelfe into admiration, when he ſhall ſee ſo rich a treaſure as Vertue and divine Grace, dwell in ſo pure a Cabinet as a lovely beauty or countenance. If ſuch beauty and glory can dwell with corruption, what excellencies are in the Saints above? Oh, if there be ſuch beauty, lovelineſſe and pleaſure in a creature, as that it hath ſuch power to draw thereunto the eyes, eares, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch as behold and conſider it, how much more beautifull and lovely is God himſelfe, who is the Ocean from which theſe, and all other excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies ſpring? How ſhould this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beauty of God attract our deſires and inflame us with love and joy?</p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:44773:149"/>
                  <p>Me thinkes I cannot leave this ſo pleaſing, lovely, divine ſubject; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yet againe: If we ſo much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, and be ſo much affected with the comelineſſe of creatures, how ſhould we be rapt at the admirable glorious beauty and luſtre of God himſelfe? Even the brighteſt, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt beauty on earth, what is it but a very little derivative from that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect, and primitive beauty which is God? but a ſparke from that infinite fire. A glimpſe from that ſun. And if this little image and Idea of beauty (which is but corporall and externall) ſo delight us; Oh, could we view and contemplate that infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, and perfect beauty in God, How ſweetly and neceſſarily ſhould we (as the Angels) love him, and be delighted therewith! Yea, if with S. <hi>Peter</hi> we could truly eſpie but one Ray thereof; We ſhould indeed ſay, It is good for us to be here, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire to build Tabernacles, and dwell where we might ever behold
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44773:150"/> ſuch beauty, ſuch glory, ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo when we conſider how our ſelves, and all true lovers freely, and gladly offer love to one another, though we be but earthly creatures, Oh let us thinke how freely God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe offers love to us, and how glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhould embrace his love, and as far as we can, love him againe. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers his love moſt freely indeed to ſuch as will accept the ſame. For Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cries out in the ſtreets, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. How lovingly doth he invite us to come into his faire Garden, to eate and drinke with him, to be merry, and to enjoy his preſence for ever. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Oh what love is this! The infinitely glorious King of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven moſt freely offers infinite love to infinitely ſinfull and miſerable beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars on earth; ſo God offers love to man. Oh let not us be ſo infinitely blinde, fooliſh, and wretched, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſame, but let us embrace it with moſt eager, ſwift, flaming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44773:150"/> and affections; and let us wholly dedicate our loves and our ſelves to him. Let us love nothing elſe but ſo as it may encreaſe our thankfulneſſe and love to him, our joy and glory in him, and as it may pleaſe and glorifie him. Let us deny our ſelves, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready endeavour to goe out of our ſelves to live above our ſelves with him, even a life heavenly on earth. Let us ſo poure forth our ſoules into God, and inſoul our ſelves into him, as that his divine love and joy, yea, himſelfe may wholly poſſeſſe us; and the rather ſince he loves us ſo freely, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4. and with an everlaſting love, <hi>Ier.</hi> 31.3.</p>
                  <p>When a foule is once thus poſſeſt with the beauty, lovelineſſe, and free love of God to it, it will be often thinking of him, often mounting up to heaven, as a vapour exhaled by that Sun of Glory; often gliding after its love, being ſo attracted by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his moſt amiable, faire, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine beauty and lovelineſſe, and alſo
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44773:151"/> the moſt free love and aſſiſtance of God himſelfe. Inſomuch as it will be enlightened with glorious thoughts, high apprehenſions, ardent affections, and heavenly joyes in him: For hee drawes us with the bands of love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4.</p>
                  <p>Yet further of this moſt excellent and heavenly ſubject, which we may the rather remember and contemplate when we have conſidered the great love of true lovers, and what they will ſuffer for one anothers ſakes. But then, oh to thinke of the infinite love of God to us, which infinitely tranſcends that of humane lovers; to conſider that this infinite glorious God ſhould ſend his only Son a part of himſelfe to redeeme and glorifie us, who have ſo offended him; that this part of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, this very God, our Saviour, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhould unvaile himſelfe of all his glory, come to live on earth, and ſuffer ſo much, ſuch a death for ſuch miſerable wretches as we are, when we were his enemies, to deliver
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44773:151"/> us from death, hell, and all miſery, and to merit for us heaven and all fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, it is ſufficient to make us over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (and with S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> even to weep) with love and joy, to think that our Love was crucified for us. See, what a Vertue is in the Paſſion of our Saviour, that if our ſoules in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of his wounds ſhould reſent the ſmart, yet knowing that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all this moſt willingly to make us happy, it is enough to make us even ſwoune with love and joy, and be exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with a thouſand ſorts of pleaſures, inſomuch as to be willing even with ſweeteſt joy to die of love for his ſake.</p>
                  <p>Oh Lord, what are we that thou ſhouldſt daigne to accept our love, but that thou ſhouldeſt ſo deſire it at ſuch a rate as thy heart blood, is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of mercy, far beyond all humane and angelicall apprehenſion; who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a devill or a blinde ignorant worldling will not greatly thanke thee, and love thee, who haſt and doeſt ſo infinitely merit the ſame; and the

Lord teach us a language wholly divine, and heavenly, to thank thee for ſuch Love. O love the Lord, all ye his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when we thinke how lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſweet diſcourſes pleaſe one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let us then alſo contemplate our ſoules ſweet converſation, diſcourſes, and ſoliloquies with our beloved God and Saviour. Oh how our ſoules may be inflamed with divine love and joy, when wee contemplate theſe moſt ſweet and pleaſant words of our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, calling us his Siſter, his Spouſe, his Love, his Dove, &amp;c. and ſaying, thou art all faire my Love, there is no ſpot in thee; Thou haſt raviſhed my heart with one of thine eyes, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. And my beloved is the faireſt among women, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand, looking forth as the morning, faire as the Moone, pure as
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44773:152"/> the Sun, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. That ſhe is a Kings daughter, As a Queene in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of Gold of Ophir, embroidered raiment of needle worke, that the King might take pleaſure in her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. Clothed with the white raiment, the righteouſneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, crowned and enriched with his tryed and purified Gold, his heavenly graces, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. O how the ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious accents of theſe words do ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh the ſpirits, and powerfully attract the hearts of all thoſe thereunto, who are able truly but to heare the Eccho of them, and to perceive the ſweetneſs thereof: Inſomuch as they are ready to borrow wings on all ſides, and to flie out of themſelves, that they may be wholly poſſeſt with the love and joy of their Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Let us then feelingly ſpeake to our beloved in the ſame language that he ſpeakes to us, then which indeed can be no better, no ſweeter. Come then my beloved, Kiſſe me with the kiſſes of thy mouth, for thy love is
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44773:153"/> better then wine; Draw me, and I will runne after thee. Shew me, Oh thou whom my ſoule loveth, where thou feedeſt, and where thou makeſt thy flock to reſt at noon, <hi>Can.</hi> 1.2, 4, 7. Stay me with thy Flagons, and comfort me with Apples, for I am ſicke of Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. Come my Beloved, let us goe forth into the fields, let us lodge in the villages, let us get up early to the vineyards, let us ſee if the Vine flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, whether the tender Grape ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and the Pomegranate bud forth; There will I give thee my Love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.11, 12. Set me as a Seale on thine heart, and as a Signet on thine arme; for Love is as ſtrong as death: it is a fire, a vehement flame, many waters cannot quench Love, and the floods cannot drowne it, &amp;c. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. Let us alſo endevour to be perſwaded with Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that neither life nor death, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, &amp;c. ſhall ever be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the love of God which
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44773:153"/> is in CHRIST, <hi>Romans chap.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>True Love, ſuffers not for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which it loves; It hath a power in it to change the nature of things: From the time that a ſoule is chaſtly taken with this paſſion, even the pains &amp; torments thereof, are changing the name and quality within the heart; They are Roſes rather then Thornes; for if it ſigh, it is of Joy, and not of paine; If it be neceſſary to die for the glory of this lovely cauſe of it's life, it is no death to it, but a meere Rap't of Contentment, which ſevers it ſelfe from it ſelfe, in favour of another ſelfe whom it loves more then it ſelfe. So that if we were truely capable of the Love, Beauty, Glory, and Excellency of our Saviour, though with Saint <hi>Lawrence</hi> wee ſhould broyle upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flames, yet our hearts which would burne more hot with the fire of his love, then that of our puniſhment, would quite extinguiſh the ſame; for our hearts being all a flame already,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44773:154"/> and our ſoules a fire, how could we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire amidſt thoſe heates, though our bodies were burned to aſhes, ſince the ſtronger muſt needs prevaile? Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we ſhould fee e the delights of heaven in the fire; whereof wee ſhould make our ſelves a crowne of glory. It ſeemes alſo <hi>Policarpus,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Glover,</hi> Maſter <hi>Sanders</hi> and others, both Primitive, and Queene <hi>Maryan</hi> Martyrs, were ſo warmed with thoſe truely Promethean fires of divine Love, as exhilarated their ſoules with heavenly delights at the ſtake in the fire. So let us endevour to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed with the baptiſme of the fire of Heavenly Love and Joy; And then how willingly and delightfully ſhall we ſuffer all the tribulations we meet with for his ſake whom our ſoules ſo divinely love and rejoyce in, Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Me thinkes I could gladly dwell in this Diſcourſe of Divine Love. The more to enflame our Loves to God, ſee how he wooes us unto his Love by
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44773:154"/> very many and gracious Promiſes of Happineſſe in his divine Word to ſuch as Love him. Inſomuch as all things ſhall worke to their good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.28. But I ſhall onely men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conclude with that of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeene, nor eare heard, neither hath it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the heart of man thoſe things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Thinke then you ſoules of the World what felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty this is. We know the eye hath ſeene moſt beautifull, lovely, and glorious things, the eare hath heard rare conſorts of Muſick &amp; Voices. The heart of man can imagine worlds of Diamonds more glorious then the Sunne, and millions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Pleaſures, Delights, and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities: What ſweet Joy and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hath the heart of Man imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Orchards of <hi>Adonis,</hi> the Gardens of <hi>Heſperides,</hi> the Delights of the fortunate Iſlands, of the Elizi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44773:155"/> Fields and Turkes Paradiſe; but let humane Imagination thinke of all theſe at once; And let them imagine alſo a Quire of Syrens; Let them joyne therunto in conſort both the Harpe of <hi>Orpheus,</hi> and Voyce of <hi>Amphian,</hi> Let <hi>Apollo,</hi> and all the Muſes bee there to beare a part; Let all the Graces, all the Nymphes be preſent in this Imaginary Paradiſe. Let them ſearch within the compaſſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture all the choyſeſt Pleaſures which it hath produced in the word hitherto, to charme our Senſes, and to raviſh our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. In ſumme, let them aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in one Subject all whatſoever is and hath beene moſt beautifull and delitious in the World; Yet are all theſe but meere Chimera's, and as a vaine Idea, a meere ſhadow of a body of pleaſure in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe divine thoughts and pleaſures which the Saints may and
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44773:155"/> ſhall enjoy in the Contemplation of God and of his infinite Beauty, Glory, Love, and of the Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which hee hath prepared for them that love him. Their thoughts and Contemplations, even in this life may be compoſed of unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glories, Crownes, Kingdomes, Divine Viſions, heavenly exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Spirit, of extreame mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilous Joyes, Pleaſures and Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. It is impoſſible to expreſſe the pleaſures of a heavenly ſoule. The Contentments thereof are not to be ſo called. It's Extaſies and Raviſhments cannot bee uttered: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the ſame; He could not tell whether he were in his body or no. So as the heart that feeles them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend them: Well and truely therefore doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>That ſuch pleaſures have not entred into the heart of man, as God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:44773:156"/> Not entred into the heart of Man? This ſeemes to be a Riddle, how can man enjoy it then? Indeed hee muſt be above a naturall man, above himſelfe that enjoyes ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; he muſt be a Partaker of the Divine Nature, of a ſuper-humane and heavenly temper; for all grace is above Nature. And if by reaſon of our Frailties and Infirmities, we cannot attaine to ſuch a height of Love to, and Joy in God in this life, yet if wee endeavour truely to love him, hee (who alwayes accepts the Will for the Deed, and whoſe power is made perfect in our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infirmities, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) will lovingly accept of our good Wiſhes, Wils, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And then there ſhall come a time when we ſhall ſee God as he is, know him as wee are knowne, love him beyond expreſſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in him infinite pleaſures and felicities for ever. And then wee
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44773:156"/> ſhall bee made like him, as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. In ſuch ſort as fire by uniting it ſelfe to Iron, in an exceeding extreame heate doth purifie the Iron, and convert the ſame into fire; In like manner (but above all degrees of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon) doth God purifie and reduce us to a being ſupernaturall and dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, unites and takes the ſoule into his owne divine Nature: And this fire which ſhall ſo unite us to God is Divine Love. And then ſhall we have a new being, we ſhall bee like him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. One with him as his members, and as a wife to her husband, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. Wee ſhall dwell in him, and he in us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.16. And then wee ſhall alſo have a new name, that is, of our Spouſe, of our Beloved, of God himſelfe; for ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, I will write upon him the Name of my God. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.12.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44773:157"/> So as hereby the ſoule becomes a part of God, and as it ſeemes, may be ſaid to bee no more a ſoule, but God himſelfe, and with him, and in him enjoyes all happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Oh then let us fervently wiſh, and long for this time which ſhall be at the marriage of the Kings Sonne, to which the Angels ſhall invite us. Then ſhall we celebrate an everlaſting wedding feaſt, our ſoules ſhall be the Bride, and Love ſhall be the banner over us; And then ſhall wee enjoy infinite plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and felicities for ever. How may the thoughts of this heavenly happineſſe delight and poſſeſſe us with divine Love and Joy before hand alſo, while we live on earth.</p>
                  <p>To come towards a Concluſion. If we could truly ſay with King <hi>Davids</hi> heart, I love the Lord; and with Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Lord thou knoweſt that I love thee; if all our ſtreame could runne in that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44773:157"/> to love only him, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things but only for him, and ſo farre as they tend to his love and glory; Oh then what peace, what delight, what a heaven upon earth ſhould we enjoy? If we were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truly to love and know God, it were impoſſible but wee ſhould be infinitely pleaſed with what hee pleaſes, and with nothing elſe. Oh Lord, if thou wouldeſt make me ſo love thee as I ſhould, and as I deſire, which is infinitely, I ſhould certainely enjoy ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in thy love, as would tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me to an heaven of joy imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly. Keepe me (I pray thee with all my ſoule) ſtill in this minde, to wiſh no other happineſſe then what I enjoy in thy love, of thy goodneſſe, to thy glory; and which may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe my love to thee. Me thinkes I can deſire nor wiſh no greater happineſſe than I now enjoy, in knowing that God (whom I would
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44773:158"/> love infinitely above my ſelfe,) is infinitely happy. I doe eſteeme it more happineſſe to mee then hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, already to know that my Love, my God is in heaven.</p>

                  <p>By eating we ſuſtaine Nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire infirmities of the body, ſatisfie hunger, pleaſe our appetites, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve life it ſelfe. Without this happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Eating we ſhould become on earth wholy miſerable, enjoy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and muſt of neceſſity die and periſh. For the moſt ſolid parts of the body are ſuſtained, ſtrengthened, and repaired by eating, as the humid parts are by drinking, and the aierie, or ſpirituall parts are by pleaſant, and comfortable ſavours, and wholſome aire. <hi>Bread ſtrengtheneth the heart of man,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.15.</p>
                  <p>Eating alſo ſerves to glad and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce the heart. And eſpecially
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:44773:160"/> Gods children and ſervants, ſhould eate with joy and gladneſſe. To ſuch ſpeaketh the wiſe Preacher, ſaying, <hi>Goe thy way eate thy bread with joy, and drinke thy wine with a merry heart, for God accepteth thy workes, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7. See alſo as before, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.13.14. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. And ſo alſo for good ſociety one with another, as thoſe ancient Chriſtians mentioned in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. who eate their bread together with gladneſſe &amp; ſingleneſſe of heart.</p>
                  <p>The moderate, naturall, conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and pleaſant uſe of eating, makes the body a fit and apt inſtrument for the Soule, yea it preſerves and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines the whole body and ſoule in due temper and good diſpoſition. Though it be true indeed that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, due, and convenient faſting, and abſtinence from meate (according to the preſcription of our Saviour, and good cuſtomes of the Church and Saints) is good and neceſſary, disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening our bodies and mindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny groſſe humours, vapours and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44773:161"/> and ſo taking away ſloth, dulneſſe, and many diſtempers, making our ſoules to become the more Angel-like, free, quicke, and ſprightly in the performance of all ſpirituall and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine exerciſes, and ſo moſt apt and well prepared for the conceiving, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, and retaining of all divine and heavenly contemplations, illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and conſolations. But this, faſting, and abſtinence is to be uſed onely at due, and convenient times, and upon occaſions, and without ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and annoyance to the body and minde. But uſually, a temperate, cheerfull dyet is beſt, both for the body and minde. And ſuch as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome themſelves to a due, moderate, and convenient dyet, are commonly obſerved to be the moſt healthfull, free, cheerfull, happy men, moſt fit &amp; beſt prepared for the performance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:44773:161"/>
                  <p>Againſt the ſuperſtitious refuſall of the good and convenient uſe of meates, and other bleſſings of God (as many Papiſts and others doe) I have written formerly in the booke called, <hi>The Terreſtriall Paradiſe:</hi> and therefore here I omit the ſame. Onely now I wiſh the ſuperſtitious therein, to read the 14. Chapter to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans: wherein it plainly appeares, that ſuch are the weaker Chriſtians, who are too nice, and ſuperſtitious in this kinde; and yet alſo that wee are not to deſpiſe, judge, and offend thoſe weake Chriſtians, ſince they doe it to pleaſe God, though ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly; but rather that wee ſhould endeavour to convert them from their ſuperſtition, mildly, lovingly, and peaceably, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. And alſo, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p>By this bleſſing of eating alſo wee may be ſtirred up to praiſe and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. and ſo to love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in him the fountaine of this,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44773:162"/> and all bleſſings. Alſo to ſeeke and enjoy the celeſtiall manna, and food of Heaven: that eternall feaſt of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and pleaſures, which we expect to enjoy in God himſelfe. Thus much of the benefits of eating in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and briefly.</p>
                  <p>In the next place according to my former method) I thinke I ſhall not need to ſtudie a way for men to gaine food or victuals, for hee that hath, or can gaine but a very meane eſtate of riches (of which I have writ before) cannot want meate and drinke largely ſufficient: yea nature is ſo bountifull in this, that who ſo hath his Armes, and his hands at liberty, need not complaine of want. And 'tis Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> command, that if any would not worke they ſhould not eate. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. Enough to ſuffice na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is everywhere to be had, and what need wee care for more than ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, enough is as good as a feaſt, as the Proverbe ſayes, and indeed better than our uſuall feaſts, yea meales,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:44773:162"/> which are commonly ſo intemperate, as wee had better to eate much leſſe than wee uſe to doe. Therefore in theſe enſuing Partitions, I thinke that ſomewhat a differing Method from the former is moſt neceſſary; and firſt to begin with the abuſes of eating, hindering happineſſe therein; the manner and extent thereof, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the dangers and remedies of theſe abuſes; and then the rules, and right order of a due, good, and convenient diet, alſo the felicities thereof, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>See then firſt the abuſes, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes thereof.</p>
                  <p>Many men finding ſuch excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, benefits, and pleaſures in eating (as hath beene ſaid) doe plunge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beyond the good uſes thereof into diſorderly and immoderate abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hindering themſelves of much happineſſe therein, and inſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cauſing much miſchiefe and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.</p>
                  <p>For now in this intemperate age, gluttony, and diſorder domineeres.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44773:163"/> What a numberleſſe many of need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Cookes, Taverne-keepers, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitmakers, and others are there in the world, who do daily bring in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary company of new inventions, making much more buſineſſe in the world than needs, in procuring this and that kinde of dainty diſh from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall countries, and after ſtrange and nice faſhions; whereas with much leſſe coſt and trouble wee might bee much better ſerved with that which growes at home, and is eaſie to be found in every village. Many men do inceſſantly weary themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in ſearching the world for rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and compounding of new deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies to ſatisfie their pride, vanitie, curioſity, their licentious, unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unnaturall, monſtrous deſires, and to ſacrifice to that Curtian Gulph, that devouring Minotaure their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whom the ordinary creatures cannot content in refreſhing nature, which is, and ought to be ſweetly pleaſed, and contented with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44773:163"/> and reaſon. But theſe will needes over-ballance, and overwhelme Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with ſuperfluities, both in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and quantitie; inſomuch as ſome, like gurmandizing <hi>Helluo's</hi> will eate enough to ſuffice many reaſonable men: ſome men will eate foure or five full meales in a day, againe and againe, before the former meale be well digeſted. Others ſit two or three howres at a meale, and ſo cauſe in time abundance of crudities, diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, corruptions, and dulneſſe both to their bodies and mindes.</p>
                  <p>'Tis ſtrange to thinke how men will ſtretch their bellies to the largeſt ſize, ſwell them as bigge as blowne bagges; ſtuffe and cramme them even top full: ſo long and often pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their paunches, as if they did not eate to live, but live to eate, and eate to dye before their time. So like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motants, they eate as if they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <hi>Polyxenus</hi> wiſh, even to have their neckes as long as Cranes, the more pleaſantly (or rather mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly)
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:44773:164"/> to glut downe their gobbets, not regarding all this while, how they ſpoyle themſelves; but ſtill endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring by all allurements of Cooke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to provoke their Epicurean ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes (though already oppreſſed) by their too curious ſallets, ſauces, and a multitude of idle devices. Theſe abuſes are ſo common, ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and not blamed as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be, as methinkes I could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to write them over againe.

                  <p>In our age many men (with <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> that Epicurean King of <hi>Arragon</hi>) could moſt unworthily wiſh rather to live tenne yeares in gluttony, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, than a hundred with tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſobriety; and ſo like <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitius,</hi> doe ſwiniſhly ſet their chiefe happineſſe in gluttony, as if they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:44773:164"/> were no better than beaſts. They ſeeme to love their guts better than God. <hi>Whoſe God is their belly,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> phraſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Their eyes ſtand out with fatneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 37.7.

Then they ſay to their ſoules, eate drinke and be merry, as hee ſayd <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. But if they repent not of their gluttony, idleneſſe, licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, luxury, impiety, God will one day ſay to them as it follows, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. <hi>Thou foole thy ſoule ſhall be required of thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Further, concerning the extent of theſe abuſes. How much doth this age goe beyond former Arges in glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony. How abſtemious were many Philoſophers and Heathens, as well as Chriſtians. How ſparing was <hi>Eliahs</hi> diet, That when hee had eaten, the Angell came to him the ſecond time and bid him eate more, but our ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44773:165"/> is ſuch, as wee had need of Angels to come daily, and bid us eate leſſe.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed that hiſtories in former ages have found out, and bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome belly-gods with infamy, and diſgrace, inſomuch as <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Geta, Galba, Caligula, Helioga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus, Sardanapalus, Vitellius, Tiberius, Lucullus, Sergius Aurata, Abdius</hi> of Rome, <hi>Fabius,</hi> called alſo for his glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony <hi>Gurges,</hi> and the reſt who are regiſtred in the liſt of gluttons; rot in their corruptions, and therefore lye more covered with infamy than with earth. But certainly never did intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance extend and ſpread it ſelfe in all reſpects more than in our times. If ever that ſaying were true, 'tis in our age: That many more periſh by intemperance, than the ſword.</p>
                  <p>Had <hi>Plato</hi> lived in our dayes, ſurely hee would have turned his divine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the prayſe of thoſe <hi>Syracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> whom in his time hee taxed of gluttony for filling their bellies twice
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44773:165"/> a day: for theſe men in reſpect of our uſages and cuſtomes may ſeeme great maſters of temperance. He that with us in our age eates but two good meales a day is applauded (and well hee may in our climate, if hee be an able ſound man) for a perſon of great temperance, and ſingular good dyet.</p>
                  <p>How many excellent, Heroicall ſpirits, noble and generous Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in our times, who have had inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and liberall education, might have lived many happy yeares in great proſperity, ſhined like bright ſtarres in their Spheres, and much good might have reflected from them to the Common-wealth, Country, and to their friends alſo, if they had not too much proſtituted themſelves to intemperate licentiouſneſſe, and ſo glutted and ſpoyled both their bodies and ſoules.</p>

                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:44773:167"/>
                  <p>Let me here tell what is written of <hi>Gorgius.</hi> That hee ſpent his whole Patrimony, rich revenues in feaſting and intemperance; ſpoyled both his body and minde by gluttony, filled his belly full of noyſome crudities and humours, grew extreame fat and foggie, his cheekes became like blowne bagges, his belly hung over his knees like an Artificiall Pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe; his legges by hydropticke humours were growne bigge enough to beare Goliah, and yet ſo weake and painefull as they could ſcarce beare this gluttonous Monſter: In ſumme, he became filled with a multitude of noyſome diſeaſes, and ſo in raging paines and diſtempers he died. Thus
<q>
                        <l>By riotous feaſting <hi>Gorgius</hi> ſpent his pelfe.</l>
                        <l>Spoyled his body, and ſo kill'd himſelfe.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To proceed, by reaſon of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly intemperate diet are ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred abundance of unneceſſary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44773:167"/> ſtopping the paſſages of the ſpirits, cloying and filling the joynts, and the whole body too full of rheumes and moiſture; cauſing dulneſſe, drowzineſſe, ſtupidity, ſloth, and lumpiſhneſſe. Every man may in time finde in himſelfe, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall, both to his body and minde a uſuall, full, intemperate diet is in this kinde.</p>
                  <p>Alſo by reaſon hereof, the ſpirits are annoyed and diſtempered, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the paſſions become enthralled, and the minde prone to all ſenſuall and evill deſires; inſomuch as it is obſerved that many intemperate gluttonous men are commonly ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to vertue and goodneſſe; exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and maintainers of diſſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and impiety.</p>
                  <p>By this meanes of an intemperate diſorderly diet, the memory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is alſo dulled and ſtupifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo the minde becommeth heavie and unapt for the performance of the functions proper thereunto;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:44773:168"/> ſuch as are, ſtudie, prayer, meditation: In ſuch ſort as the quickneſſe and activity of the ſoule is quite dampt, utterly diſabled, and made unfit for any good excellent imployments, to conceive or receive deepe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine contemplations, or heavenly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations, by reaſon of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and burthenſome fulneſſe of a diſtempered diſordered body.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore let us by all meanes avoid intemperate and diſorderly ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: It ſeemes we ſhould rather put a knife to our throat then ſpoyle our ſelves with gluttonous eating. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1.2. <hi>And when wee have eaten and are full, then let us beware leſt we forget the Lord, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 6.11. Let us pray with wiſe <hi>Agur. Feed me O Lord with foode convenient for me, leſt I be full and deny thee, or leſt I want, &amp;c. Prov.</hi> 30.8.9.</p>
                  <p>So let us eſchew all abuſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate eating, and accuſtome our ſelves to ſuch a good, moderate, and convenient courſe of diet, as I intend
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44773:168"/> to treat of in the next enſuing Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which if we uſe our ſelves unto (as ſhall be dilated) will be ſufficient, pleaſant, and moſt beneficiall.</p>
                  <p>It is onely an ill cuſtome that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes the appetite and deſire beyond a due meaſure and order, wherefore if wee have by intemperance brought our ſtomackes to an inordinate deſire of eating: let us now alter the ſame by a contrary good cuſtome. It is ſafer for bodily health to decline an ill cuſtome in this kinde by degrees, then ſuddenly, in as much as ſudden alterations doe much diſtemper and indanger the body: but if the ſame be by little and little abated, it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſtomack by degrees to a good diſpoſition and temper; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the ſame as its former greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe will bee abated, and it will bee contented with that which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as appeares by ſome ſtudents, and others, who having lived a ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, and uſed to eate three or foure meales in a day, finding the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44773:169"/> ſame to dull their bodies and mindes, have abated of their uſuall cuſtomes, and by little and little brought their ſtomackes to deſire but two meales in a day, ſo as they have beene as well pleaſed therewith, &amp; ſo in much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter temper then formerly. And let us know that we may ſtill eate ſuch and ſo much as is neceſſary, ſufficient, moſt pleaſant and beneficiall in all reſpects, as ſhall bee ſhewed, and which is ſuch a due proportion and order, as is to be dilated in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sections.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the intent that we may be happy in reſpect of eating, let us duely order and uſe the ſame; otherwiſe being abuſed the ſame becomes evill, and

We ought therefore rightly to order and moderate our ſelves in this matter, eating ſo much, of ſuch kinde, and in ſuch ſort, as may maintaine our bodies and mindes in good temper, and not any way diſtemper and annoy the ſame.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as there is great difference in reſpect of the ſeverall kindes of meate, of the climate, the time and manner of eating, and the age, complexion, and conſtitution of our bodies, and of our accuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner of living and exerciſe, this matter would require a very large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe, but I ſhall onely endeavour to give a taſte concerning ſome prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall matters herein, yet ſo much as perchance will bee neceſſary in this compendious diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, briefely then concerning ſuch as are of a phlegmaticke complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of a dull, ſlow, lazie condition. It is beſt for them to uſe ſomewhat a ſparing diet (eſpecially at ſupper)
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:44773:170"/> eaſie of digeſtion, dry, warme, free from vapours, not too fat and foggie, roaſt rather then ſod, bread white, and well baked, to eate a cruſt thereof, or ſome other hard and dry morſell at the end of their meales after drinke. Hearbs and rootes, hot and dry are beſt for them; to name onely ſome few and common, as Marigold, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, Perſley, Penny-Royall, Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, Sage, Marjoram, Baume, Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, Hyſop, Time, Savory, Origan, Stychas, Cowſlip, young Creſſes, Vervin, Setwell, Germander, Angel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico, the flowers of Meliot and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momill, Baſill rootes, and the reſt which are hot and dry in operation. Alſo Salt, ſalted meates, Muſtard and the like are ſomtimes good for them, as likewiſe Pepper, Nutmeg, Cloves, Macis, Ginger, Cinamon, and other Spices.</p>
                  <p>Alſo concerning ſuch as are of a Sanguine complexion, and of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, vaine, and ſenſuall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, alſo for young men, a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:44773:170"/> diet, coole, ſoluble, and of little nouriſhment, is moſt convenient for them; As alſo hearbs that are cold and dry in operation, ſuch as are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dive, Succory, Sorrell, Borrage, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloſſe, Strawberry-leaves, Cinqfoile, and others: Alſo let them uſe Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Sene, and ſuch others as purge and clenſe the bloud: As alſo open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing potions, Julips and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now for ſuch as are of a cholerick complexion, of impatient, raſh, or of quicke, active, ſturring conditions, a larger quantity of diet may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to them then to the phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, ſo as their diet be not too ſalt, hot, hard, and dry, but rather it ſhould bee coole, freſh, moiſt, and ſoluble; And they may the rather eate ſuch a more plentifull diet then others, becauſe their hot and dry bodies are better, and ſooner able to digeſt the ſame; And becauſe ſuch a liberall diet doth allay the impatiencie, and the extravagant lightneſſe and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring of their ſpirits. And therefore
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44773:171"/> ſolid meates are not amiſſe for them; Fiſhes are cooling and good for them, eſpecially freſh Fiſh: Alſo all cooling hearbs, as Lettuce, Sorrell, Endive, Bugloſſe, Fumitory, Borage, Spinage, Beets, Violet leaves, Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, Purſlane, Water-Lillies, and the like: Alſo Cucumers, Melons, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, eſpecially baked or ſod, and after cold; Plummes, eſpecially Damſons, ſtu'd Prunes, and ſuch other coole or moiſt things.</p>
                  <p>And alſo for ſuch men as are of a melancholy complexion, of ſad, timorous, and ſullen conditions; likewiſe for old men, a temperate diet is moſt convenient, and ſuch as is eaſie of digeſtion, warme, ſod, young, moiſt, and of good juice, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment. Butter, Honey, and all ſuch things as are hot and moiſt in operation; As alſo all cordiall hearbs and ſpices which revive and quicken the ſpirits, as Marigold, Roſemary, Marjoram, Sage, Baulme, Bettony, Hyſop, Time, Savory, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:44773:171"/> Bugloſſe, Clove-gilliflowers, Cowſlip flowers: Alſo Ginger, Cloves, Nutmeg, Indian Nut, Cina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Saffron, are ſaid to be cordiall; with all other things which doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive and comfort the heart and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are good for them.</p>
                  <p>But of theſe directions concerning diet, with divers other tending to the rectifying of humours, and to the health and welfare both of the body and mind, I have written more at large in a former booke called, <hi>The happie minde.</hi> Therefore now I proceed.</p>
                  <p>Some Phyſitians ſay that the moſt ſoluble and lighteſt meate, that which is eaſieſt of digeſtion, is beſt to bee firſt eaten at meales, becauſe then the ſame will better digeſt, and ſooner deſcend after concoction, whereas if laſt eaten after more hard and binding meate is by the ſame hindered to deſcend, and ſo being digeſted before the other is apt to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie and ingender crudities, the cauſe of obſtructions and many diſeaſes;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:44773:172"/> yet ſome are of opinion that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke mingles all confuſedly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, making thereof that which they call Chylus; yet the ſafeſt way is beſt to be taken, and experience may teach us that a due and convenient order is good. But indeed it is beſt (they ſay) to eate but of one or two ſorts of meate at a meale, or if of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, that they differ not much in quality.</p>
                  <p>For the quantity, let the ſtrength of our ſeverall ſtomackes bee our beſt guide; and let us keepe rather within then exceede the ſame. Three reaſonable meales in a day is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for any complexion, and two for ſuch as are phlegmaticke, which proportion is allowed and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the beſt Phyſitians of our times, to ſuch as are in health and of a good temper, and for our climate in England. There ought to be ſixe at leaſt or eight houres betweene each meale to ſuch healthy well tempered men. And it is beſt to eate when the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:44773:172"/> ſtomacke and appetite deſires, and is by ſuch a diſtance of time well prepared for it, and the former meale well digeſted. And ſometimes to forbeare a meale, or faſt a day till the evening, or to eate but a little therein; (eſpecially to ſuch as are phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) doth clenſe and purifie both the body and minde, and makes the ſame the more free, apt, and fit for all good exerciſes and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Somewhat more may be allowed to bee eaten in Winter then in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and in our Northerne cold, then in a more hot climate. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe (which is uſually rectified natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) children and old men by reaſon of the debilitie of nature are not able to receive much at once, and therefore eate little, yet ſomewhat often. Luſty young able men of ſtrong conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, good ſtomackes, and digeſtion, uſually doe, and may eate more then weake, crazie, ſickly people. A ſpare diet, and eſpecially a light ſupper is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:44773:173"/> beſt for ſuch men as are ſubject to phlegme, rheumes, and defluxion, and it is good for them to ſtay up or walke an houre or two after ſupper before they goe to bed. Leane cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke men finde much hurt by long abſtinence from meate, and ſo (it is ſaid) doe ſuch as are much ſubject to ingender winde in their ſtomackes; therefore ſuch may eate more and oftner then the phlegmaticke. It ſeemes alſo by common experience that ſuch as live in the Country, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in a cleer and ſharp aire, and do uſe labour and exerciſe, can well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a meale in a day more (though their meales be alſo larger) then ſuch as live in cloſe Cities and Townes with little exerciſe of body.</p>
                  <p>Now to adde ſome cautions in, and excitations too, the obſervance of the former Rules, encreaſing our happineſſe therein. All which Rules and preſcriptions before mentioned in this Section, wee neede not too p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eciſely to obſerve, as ſome men
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:44773:173"/> over nicely doe, bringing themſelves to overmuch care and ſlavery, in the obſervation and caution about the number and diverſities of the ſame Rules, and divers others, preſcribed by many Phyſitians. For why, ſomtimes upon occaſion, if we be drawne into ſome exceſſes, diminutions, and digreſſions, if they bee not much nor often, are of little prejudice to bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health; ſo as our uſuall cuſtome be to obſerve a temperate and good diet. And alſo it is obſerved, they that tie themſelves to a conſtant ſtrict courſe, doe contract their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes to ſuch a habit, as they are not able to endure errors when they happen: Wherefore it ſeemes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is not amiſſe to digreſſe, ſo as it bee but ſeldome and little, and ſo as we returne to, and uſually keep an orderly and temperate courſe therein.</p>
                  <p>Nor are we by any meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne ſuch Rules, concerning an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and temperate diet, but to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:44773:174"/> and obſerve the ſame, as farre as wee may conveniently, without too much care and perplexity therein, for that, much, long, or often digreſſes therefrom, are very pernitious and hurtfull, and are an occaſion of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all manner of diſtempers and diſeaſes both of minde and body. And we are to know, that as all vertue, ſo this of temperance is moſt perfect and pure when it is obſerved in the moſt orderly and exact manner, which if wee cannot performe ſo preciſely and exactly as we ſhould, yet the meere obſervance thereof may be in ſome ſort beneficiall.</p>
                  <p>Which Rules we ſhall not onely be willing, but thinke our ſelves very happie and much rejoyce to obſerve, and uſe with all conveniencie, if wee conſider the eaſineſſe, pleaſantneſſe, and ſufficiencie of ſuch an orderly, convenient, and temperate courſe of diet, and the many benefits which ſpring from thence, eſpecially to ſuch as are ſtudious and religious, of

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat ſuch a due order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of diet, as is preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the former Section, is ſufficient and eaſie to be obſerved, appeares; for as much as a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man deſires no more, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and hee thinkes it a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant thing to be temperate: whereas, diſorder and intemperance diſpleaſes, and perchance diſtempers him; yea, even very bruits may teach ſome men; they are even as well pleaſed with convenient foode as daintie, and eate not to diſtemper, but ſatisfie; How ſeldome doe wee finde any of them diſeaſed, unleſſe by mans miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing them, otherwiſe they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſound and uncomplaying.</p>
                  <p>And by experience we know that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44773:175"/> two or three reaſonable meales in a day is largely ſufficient to content any ſtomacke, which is not diſorderly accuſtomed to more.</p>
                  <p>And to the intent wee may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know that ſuch an order and quantity of diet is largely ſufficient, let me tell how divers Phyſitians and others have preſcribed and uſed much more nice and ſtrict allowances as one meale a day, and ſome about foureteene or ſixteene ounces; and doe exact much more obſervation and caution, about the quality of diet, the times of eating, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe ſuch a number of Rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſeverall kindes of diet, as well compounds as ſimples, as would very much perplex ſome men, and bring them to perfect ſlavery to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſo many and ſeverall Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And it is not unlike but many of them have obſerved in themſelves, ſuch ſtrict Rules as they have preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to others, ſo farre as conveniently they might, and that they thought
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44773:175"/> themſelves happie in ſo doing. Wee reade of the Inhabitants of the old world, alſo of the Indians called <hi>Pandorae,</hi> and another ſort called <hi>Seres,</hi> likewiſe of the <hi>Floridans,</hi> alſo of a people called <hi>Macrobii</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> and of the ſect of <hi>Eſſaeans</hi> in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> that lived very long, and fared very hardly. The like we reade of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals,</hi> and the <hi>Perſians</hi> in antient times, that they uſed a very ſpare diet, whereby they lived long, and had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquaintance with Phyſicke or Phyſitians. So alſo we reade of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Plato, Iſocrates, Tully,</hi> and divers others, that uſed a very temperate ſparing diet, and yet lived long. It is recorded of <hi>Herodicus,</hi> that being but of a very crazie conſtitution of body; yet by vertue of a very preciſe diet at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the age of an hundred yeers. And of <hi>Socrates,</hi> that by reaſon of a temperate ſober diet, he had alwayes a ſtrong bodie, and lived all his time in good health. And that <hi>Calanus</hi> the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44773:176"/> Philoſopher lived ſo ſeventy three yeeres without any ſickneſſe. <hi>Aſcle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piades</hi> relied ſo much upon his good temperate diet, that (it is ſaid) hee would lay a great wager againſt fortune, that hee would never fall ſicke, but die meerely of old age. How courſe was the diet of <hi>Daniel</hi> and his three companions, and of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt! It is ſtrange to reade of the prodigious abſtinence of divers antient Hermits, Anacho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and Fathers of the Church in former ages; who are regiſtred in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Authors! Many of them eate but once a day, and fared onely with bread and water, or with hearbes and ſome other meane ſuſtenance, whereby they lived very long and healthie. And of that admirable example of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian <hi>Lodo vicke Cornaro,</hi> who did eate and drink very ſparingly many yeeres together by a juſt weight, by which meanes he recovered his health, and lived long after, continuing an able man, both in ſtrength and ſenſes, till
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44773:176"/> he came to bee above a hundred yeeres of age! Indeed, if we (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in our climate) ſhould attempt to obſerve and to keepe exactly, ſuch a prodigious, ſevere, and ſtrict courſe of diet, as ſome men have thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and exemplified, it might hinder the vigor and welfare both of our bodies and mindes, cauſing much weakneſſe, melancholy, and diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; and would be too great, rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſlavery, and ſuperſtition, unleſſe the temperature of our bodies requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame. Yet this good uſe wee may make thereof (to which intent I write the ſame) that ſeeing learned and wiſe men have preſcribed ſuch ſtrict and rigid courſes of diet, and many men have lived long and in good health by uſing ſuch courſes; and being accuſtomed thereunto thought the ſame ſufficient, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: how much more ſhould wee thinke a farre better, more reaſonable, large, and dainty diet, (ſuch as our later and more experienced Phyſitians
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:44773:177"/> approve of, for our climate; namely, two or three reaſonable meales in a day, of ſuch good and wholeſome foode as our Country uſually affords, in a due and orderly manner) to bee moſt ſufficient, eaſie to be obſerved, pleaſant, and delightfull.</p>
                  <p>The ſtomacke being uſed to ſuch a temperate diet, and being thereby well prepared, it maketh ordinary diet equall, yea, more pleaſant to the temperate man, then rare dainties to the idle gluttonous man, whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is uſually unhealthie, and ſtomack out of temper by diſorder and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                  <p>And as ſuch a temperate, orderly, and convenient diet is ſufficient in all reſpects for nature, health, and delight; ſo alſo is it moſt excellent and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall. Though ſometimes, variety of meate, and a free diet be not amiſſe (eſpecially for ſuch as are cholericke, leane, and ſuch as uſe much exerciſe and labour) yet let men (eſpecially phlegmaticke, groſſe men, alſo Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:44773:177"/> and ſuch as live ſedentary lives without exerciſes and ſtirring, and moſt eſpecially ſuch of them as are ſtudious and religious) ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what excellent benefits, many learned Phyſitians, do tell us, proceed from a good temperate, ſpare, and meane diet; and as they ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, let them obſerve the ſame. Theſe enſuing conſiderations thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſoule to bee at leiſure for them. I ſhall endeavour to collect briefely ſome of the principall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits thereof.</p>
                  <p>They tell us, that a temperate good diet is an occaſion of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, which maketh good bloud, and ingendreth good ſpirits; That the ſame prevents crudities, rheumes, obſtructions, and ſuch diſeaſes as are bred thereby, which are indeed almoſt all uſuall maladies: yea, that a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe ate, ſpare diet cureth, or at leaſt mitigateth all thoſe diſeaſes that have beene ſo bred in us by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, diſorder and fulneſſe, though
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44773:178"/> already ſeized upon us, by making an eaſie and generall evacuation in the body; conſuming the crudities, rheumes, and ſuperfluous humours therein, extenuating that which is over-thickned, opening obſtructions, and ſo unlocking all the paſſages of the humours and ſpirits. That here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo head-ach and dizzineſſe is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, fluxes ſtayed, loathſome Itches taken away; In ſumme, all the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, corrupted, and ill humours in the body whatſoever, are hereby drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cleered. All which is done eaſily, without diſturbance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paine, without coſt and loſſe of time, without ſtirring and diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the humours; ſo as this moſt excellent medicine of a temperate and ſpare diet ſeemes to bee the beſt phyſicke that can be. How many men doe we reade and often heare of, who have beene ſubject to Gouts, and other diſeaſes by phyſicke incurable, have yet quite recovered their health, or at leaſt their diſeaſes have beene
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44773:178"/> much mitigated, and eaſed by ſuch a good, temperate, and ſparing diet?</p>
                  <p>By ſuch a good, temperate diet, the body is kept cleane from all noyſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and filthineſſe, and made heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie, agill, lightſome, and expedite to performe the motions appertaining thereunto. Sound and quiet ſleepe is alſo hereby cauſed; the temperate man gets up at peepe of day, (ſaith one) freſh as the morning it ſelfe, full of vigor and activity both of body and minde, well prepared, and apt for all manner of affaires. The ſonne of Syrach affirmes this. Sound ſleepe commeth of moderate eating (ſaith he) and a temperate man riſeth early, and his wits are with him. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 31.</p>
                  <p>Such a diet is alſo an occaſion of long life. It is moſt certaine and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, but a good, temperate, convenient diet doth prolong the life of man; in ſo much as by vertue thereof a mans life may bee happily lengthned to well-nigh a hundred yeeres or more, as hath beene plainely
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44773:179"/> ſhewed by the former examples. And experience (as well as millions of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in former ages) teacheth that by reaſon of ſuch a diet, many men attaine to a good and happie old age.</p>
                  <p>The ſame alſo is an occaſion of a calme, quiet death; for ſuch men as have beene accuſtomed to ſuch a good temperate diet, having thereby prevented evill humours, there is but little inward cauſe to moleſt them, ſo as their ſoules part from their bodies eaſily and quietly, with little diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of nature and paſſions.</p>
                  <p>A temperate and ſpare diet alſo ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away the occaſions of ſloth and dulneſſe, which are abundance of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary humours, ſtopping the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the ſpirits, cloying the joynts, and filling them too full of moyſture; theſe being taken away, the ſpirits are cleered and purified: ſo as the minde alſo is leſſe clogged with the groſſe vapours of fulneſſe and repletion; whereby the ſenſes are kept ſound, the
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44773:179"/> paſſions mollified, the affections well tempered, evill concupiſcence abated, and the whole ſoule freed from abundance of incumbrances. Hereby alſo the reaſon is cleered, the wit ſharpned, the underſtanding ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated, and the whole ſoule made more cheerefull, quick, ſprightly, piercing, and free to apprehend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and retaine all good, all divine, and excellent matters.</p>
                  <p>If we peruſe all hiſtories, we ſhall finde, that ſuch as are regiſtred for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent in the liſt of Princes, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and Souldiers, and as men of excellent ſpirits, and of moſt heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call performances for the benefit of mankinde, are commonly alſo regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred for the friends and followers of temperance, as was <hi>Cyrus, Auguſtus, Alexander Severus, Socrates, Marcus Cato, Epimnondas,</hi> The Roman <hi>Curii,</hi> and <hi>Fabritii,</hi> with many others. The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> as valiant as they were, made expreſſe profeſſion of vertue and temperance. And we may
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44773:180"/> alwayes obſerve that temperate men are commonly vertuous and pious men. The wiſe man ſaith. Bleſſed art thou, O Land, when thy Princes eate in due ſeaſon, &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.16.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, let us then moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embrace this divine vertue of temperance: And ſo in a good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and convenient manner; let us eate and drinke with joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7.) the rather ſince it is (as hath beene ſaid) ſo good, and ſo comely a thing ſo to doe (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.24.) and likewiſe ſo ſufficient, ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and ſo beneficiall.</p>

And as was ſaint <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, ſo his practiſe: Hee tooke bread, and gave thankes to God, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 27.35.

Therefore let not us ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deſpiſe, and refuſe the good uſe of ſuch gifts and bleſſings of God, but rather in a good and temperate manner uſe them to the health and welfare both of our bodies and minds (as hath beene ſhewed) and as here
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:44773:181"/> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth us to the praiſe and glory of God.</p>
                  <p>And ſince our Country and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition affords plenty and variety for our entertaine, Oh let us bee very thankfull to our moſt gratious Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for the liberall uſe of theſe his creatures, and acknowledge this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſeable mercie, that we have not yet according to our demerits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured that grievous and inſupportable miſery of hunger and famine, which other Nations, Kingdomes, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and Families have ſuffered, but have foode both corporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, even Gods plenty! And in the midſt of our dainties and varieties: let us ſometimes remember the miſery wherewith poore hungry peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are tortured. Heaven might have given them plenty and us want. Oh then, let us eſpecially at ſeaſonable times beſtow ſome part of our plenty on their miſerable wants. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ſuch as give of their bread and meate to the poore. <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.9.

                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.13.

                  <p>And let the ſweeteneſſe, pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and benefits, of theſe terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, externall felicities, excite us to ſeeke for, and taſte of that heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> of divine grace, which is ſo excellent, that many Saints of God, even in this life, have and doe enjoy a continuall feaſt within them, which is the tranquillity of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And indeed theſe pleaſures of eating, and other the like enjoyances (which are but little rayes, glimpſes, and reflexions of eternall heavenly delights) doe principally ſerve to this purpoſe, to enlighten and guide us to

Wiſedome hath killed her Oxen already, hath mingled her Wine, hath furniſhed her table, and moſt lovingly invites us to come to eate of her bread, &amp;c. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.2.5. There is the milke of the word, the bread of the Sacrament, the Oyle of the ſpirit, that heavenly unction which cheeres the countenance, and

There the faithfull eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſoule, the Bride of the Kings ſonne is invited and led into his faire banquetting houſe, and into his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant garden of Myrrhe and ſpices, eates.

                  <p>Yea, our beloved Saviour Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe, offers, knocks, cals, and if we will open unto him, he will come into us, and will ſup with us, and we with him. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. Oh what heavenly cates, viands, and dainties can they want, whom God himſelfe pleaſeth to come in unto, to dwell with, and to feaſt withall!

Oh hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, thrice happy, infinitely, Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy are ſuch men then, who can taſte of and enjoy this bread of life, this heavenly bread of eternall life! Oh ſweete Saviour give us daily this bread. Let us eſpecially endeavour to taſte and feede on this divine food, by faith in our hearts, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to the Sacrament thereof, even with ſweeteſt heavenly joy and thankſgiving.</p>

                  <p>To proceede, let this happineſſe of eating, make us often mindfull of that celeſtiall, eternall love-feaſt, the Lambs Supper, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.9. where Heaven ſhall bee our banqueting-houſe; the Angels our attendants, and Jeſus Chriſt our Bridegroome, and where we ſhall enjoy millions of pleaſures for ever. Then ſhall we be abundantly ſatisfied with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Gods owne houſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.8. Then ſhall we everlaſtingly feede on that moſt delitious Manna, the foode of Heaven, the ſweetneſſe of eternall joy and happineſſe; which if we could but truely thinke of, even in this life, it were ſufficient to charme our ſpirits with ſweeteſt, divineſt heavenly pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>The ſweeteſt delights are divine and heavenly, and the way to reliſh them beyond all ſweets is often to muſe and taſte of them, for having our ſoules often contemplating and

                  <p>How many men have been ſo tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported in the divine contemplation of the ſweetneſſe of God, and of his heavenly excellencies, as they have ſeemed already to feaſt on the joies of eternity.

                  <p>To ſpeake the ſame againe. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thirſt is quenched, naturall moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture preſerved, good digeſtion of meate cauſed, the ſpirits quickned, and the vigor and welfare both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde maintained, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times love and good-fellowſhip by mutuall pledgings and entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is thereby encreaſed.</p>
                  <p>This alſo may ſtirre us to praiſe and love God for ſuch his bleſſings, alſo to look up to, and rejoyce in him their fountain, &amp; ſo to ſearch &amp; enjoy that Celeſtiall Nectar, that water of eternall life, thoſe rivers of pleaſures which are to be enjoyed in and with God himſelfe for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the abuſes of drinking, and the extent thereof in this drinking age. Our depraved na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture finding and eſpying ſuch delight and benefits in drinking (ſee now a miſchiefe) is prone to go beyond the good uſes thereof into abuſes, ſo hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring our ſelves of the happines which
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44773:186"/> otherwiſe we might have therein, and cauſing much evill and miſery.</p>
                  <p>Firſt concerning the manner of theſe abuſes. Many young men of hot, cholericke, and ſanguine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, and ſuch as are of impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, light, unſetled, wavering, and phantaſticke conditions, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly drinke of the ſtrongeſt, ſtaleſt, wine and beere, adding more fuell to their already too hot fires, over-heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inflaming their bodies &amp; ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, making themſelves more hot, cholericke, impatient, phantaſticke, idle, &amp;c. Some groſſe fat men will uſually drinke ſweete, muddy, thicke, new wine, ale, and beëre, encreaſing their groſſeneſſe and corpulencie: And ſo of the like.</p>
                  <p>But our moſt ordinary and generall fault is, wee commonly drinke too much hot and ſtrong wine and drinks; It is a moſt uſuall cuſtome when wee meete together to drinke beyond a due meaſure and proportion. And ſome more then their ſtrength and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44773:186"/> braines will afford, perhaps till they are ſick, ſottiſh, wilde, or till they tumble, vomit, ſleepe, or the like. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there are yet worſe ſwil-bowles, more notable, ſtrong-brained drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, who will ſwallow whole cups and cans in abundance, turne through their guts whole barrels in few dayes, as much as would ſuffice twenty or thirty reaſonable men, and yet ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhrinke at it; of theſe able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd, Grand, Arch-drinkers, of their common ill conditions, and how they are more dangerous and worſe then weake brain'd drinkers, I intend to write in the next Section.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in reſpect of time, both in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of time, and at unfit times; It is common that men will ſit drinking five or ſix houres together in Taverns and tipling-houſes, yea, ſome whole dayes and nights. And the night (as if they were in another Horizon, to make our night their day) many men eſteeme the onely time to roare in; As for ſleepe (then which indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44773:187"/> is better for them) they ſeeme to hate it as deaths cater-cozen, and cannot afford to ſpend the night ſo idely, as if God made ſtarres to ſleep by. So alſo when tis fit they were about other better and neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and occaſions. And ſome make the Lords day of all the dayes in the weeke, the eſpeciall day to goe to the tap-houſe and tipple in, and that too as ſoone as ever they are out of the Church; yea, many men even in the time of divine ſervice will ſlide into a Tavern or Alehouſe, and think they are out of the Devils danger, if neither the Prieſt, the Juſtice, the Churchwardens, their Parents, nor Maſters ſee them.</p>
                  <p>Alſo in reſpect of mens eſtimation and affections. Divers men love drinke too much, even againſt nature and reaſon. They ſeeme to eſteeme Sacke good liquor, and idle tipling devices and courſes above all the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites of the world beſides; yea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Heaven and God himſelfe. So as their chiefe happineſſe ſeemes to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:44773:187"/> be little better then the felicity of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationall creatures, a littleſhort plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the throate, and ſome other idle fugitive delights, the end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is commonly melancholy and ſorrow; and yet how many men doe eſteeme it a brave worthy action to drinke ſtoutly. Though in truth a Horſe or a Cow may doe as worthy a buſineſſe, yet this is the prime boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and glory of our ſwill-bowles and pot-gallants. They thinke it a victory, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> worthy a triumph (though baſely) to make another man (to uſe their owne termes) foxt, flawd, fud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd, payd, ſcowr'd, pepper'd, potſhot, ſlaſht, caſheir'd, and the like.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the extent of theſe drinking abuſes, divers <hi>Greekes,</hi> as <hi>Agamemnon, Neſtor,</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> (yet in their later dayes onely) are in Hiſtories taxed as infamous for abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive drinking; Alſo <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi> that drinke devouring <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Heliogabulus,</hi> and others. Some ancient writers have taxed the <hi>Lydians,</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:44773:188"/> the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Thracians,</hi> the <hi>Caeltae,</hi> and the <hi>Teutons,</hi> (by whom is meant the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and <hi>Germans.</hi>) But in our age theſe abuſive drinking courſes doe extend themſelves in almoſt all the Countries of the world, among all ſorts of people. The <hi>Dutch</hi> men of all others have greateſt aſperſions laid upon them in this kinde. The <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvanians, Wallachians, Hungarians,</hi> and <hi>Polanders,</hi> are ſaid to drinke after the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The <hi>Danes, Swedes, Norwayans,</hi> and of late yeeres the <hi>French</hi> alſo are noted of exceſſive and riotous drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; yea, tis ſaid, that abuſive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is (not onely) the Epidemicall diſeaſe or vice (of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation which abounds with an unneceſſary company of Tavernes and Tap-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) but of the whole world it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe drinking abuſes extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in reſpect of all ages, ſexes, conditions, and degrees. Some old men who ought to give better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will to the Taverne, tipple, and abuſe themſelves: And young men
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:44773:188"/> alſo, ſome by that time they come to three or foure yeeres ſtanding in bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, can travell to the Taverne and Tap-houſe, and at ſixteene or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeeres of age, they are able to commence Maſters in the Art of drinking. Some women alſo will tipple, ſmoke, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Theſe drinking abuſes are not only uſed by the moſt unworthy and worſt ſort of men (which is common) but alſo, by many (elſe) wiſe men of good parts, worth, and degree, and (which is to be ſorrowed for) ſuch as are of a faire, loving, kinde, free, pleaſant, and ſociable carriage and behaviour, are often more allured and carried away (both by inward and outward provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations) to theſe drinking courſes, then others ſottiſh punie people and ſordid Miſers, who are commonly in this reſpect free. Alſo theſe drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abuſes extend themſelves to men of all degrees; not onely to Hoſts, Tapſters, Pedlers, &amp;c. but alſo to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Tradeſemen, of whom many
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44773:189"/> thouſand ſpend on the Sunday and Holidayes in Tap-houſes almoſt as much as they gain in the week before, to the great griefe, and euen undoing of their families; and tis commonly noted the beſt workmen are the worſt husbands. Alſo ſome Conſtables, Churchwardens, Sidemen, Alecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the reſt, who by the Statute ought to preſent ſuch abuſes, will herein often abuſe themſelves; ſo as it is need to preſent them. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome of all ſorts, Merchants, Souldiers, Lawyers, Phyſitians, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Gallants, and great men; will too much and too often goe to and ſtay at the Tavern, and tipple, roar, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Seeing theſe drinking abuſes doe thus extend themſelves, and are ſo common, let us take heede they hurt not us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> was ſo abſtinent in this kinde, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> bids him drink no more water but a little wine, for his healths ſake. But if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were to write to a number of men in
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44773:189"/> our dayes, who are ſo buſie with healths, &amp;c. ſurely he would charge them, as they loved the health and welfare both of their bodies and ſoules, not to drinke ſo much wine, &amp;c.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Et us now briefely view the evill and miſerable effects of abuſive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, to the intent wee may eſchew the ſame, and bee happy therein. Theſe evill and miſerable effects are many and various (both concerning body and minde) according to the ſeverall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and complexions of men; and ſome proceeding from exceſſive moiſt and cold cauſes, ſome from
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44773:190"/> hot, ſome from corrupted, and ſome of mixt cauſes and diſtempers. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance briefely, and firſt concerning ſuch as are cold, moiſt, and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke men.</p>
                  <p>Though it be good and comely to eate and drink in a good &amp; temperate manner, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. Yet Phyſitians ſay, that over-much moyſture cauſed by much and diſorderly drinking (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of ſtrong drinkes) doth peſter and dull the braine by the exhalations of a multitude of unneceſſary va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; the ſuperfluity whereof (by reaſon of the weakneſſe &amp; coldneſſe of the braine, after the heate of the liquor is paſt) remaines undigeſted and raw; and being there refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is an occaſion of much cold phlegme and rhumes, which diſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other parts of the body, and in time, perchance doe corrupt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie the ſame, and fill it full of ill noyſome humours and diſtempers. Theſe diſtillations are the fountaine and cauſe of divers infirmities, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44773:190"/> an ill ſtomacke, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of meate, ill digeſtion, unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thirſt, apoplexies and paralyſies even depriving ſome men of their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, alſo a diſtempered lethargy, or ſleepy lazineſſe, yawning, dulneſſe, and heavineſſe, dropſies alſo, and purfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, fatneſſe, groſeneſſe, ſweld bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, gouts, and hydropticke humours deſcending into the legges: whence it commeth to paſſe that oftentimes thoſe cold diſeaſes are ingendred in many men, who uſually drinke ſtrong and hot drinkes, eſpecially to ſuch as are of the phlegmaticke complexion, and ſomtimes to the ſanguine and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly. Alſo the body working up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſoule by the mediation of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and humours, is a cauſe that from theſe cold diſeaſes do proceed many diſtempers in the minde, as dulneſſe, heavineſſe, forgetfulneſſe, drowſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, lazineſſe, and a minde unfit for any good, worthie, excellent actions and contemplations, and in ſome men even a deprivation of reaſon and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44773:191"/> Hence it is (as we may obſerve) that there are many dull, ſottiſh, ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, lazie, heavie maudlin tiplers. <hi>Wine takes away the heart. Hoſea</hi> 4.11.</p>
                  <p>And alſo, that exceſſe of ſtrong and hot drinkes cauſeth inflammati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heart, liver, bloud, and of the other humours, and the ſpirits, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to ſuch men as are of a hot, cholericke, and ſanguine complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from whence proceede divers diſtempers and diſeaſes; as <hi>Vertigo</hi> or giddineſſe in the head, and paines therein, lightneſſe of the braine, weakeneſſe of nerves and ſinnewes, diſtemperature of ſpirits; alteration of colour and complexion, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in ſome men fiery lookes, pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled faces, and red noſes; alſo to ſome Pleuriſie, burning-Feavers, and violent raging ſickneſſe and death. By reaſon alſo of theſe inflammations of humours and ſpirits, and other hot diſtempers, the minde being thereby tickled and diſtempered becommeth vaine-glorious, conceited; prone to
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44773:191"/> ſenſuall deſires, riot, and all manner of prodigality: alſo to anger, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, curſings, ſwearing, ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, gybing, quarrelling, fighting, and ſtabbing. <hi>Srong drinke is raging. Prov.</hi> 20.1.</p>
                  <p>And further, that exceſſive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cauſeth melancholy and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. True it is, that wine and ſtrong drinkes, if moderately uſed, doe heate and quicken that heavie, cold, dry, thicke humour of the ſpleene, called naturall melancholy, cauſing mirth and cheerefulneſſe, even in the moſt ſurly and ſevereſt people. But in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, doth coole, diſtemper, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the ſtomacke and ſpleene, with too great a conflux of ill humours, over-whelming, waſting, dulling, and diſtempering thoſe good and pure ſpirits, which otherwiſe would cauſe cheerefulneſſe, and being thereby mixed with ſuch cold phlegme and diſtillations as come from the braine after the heate of the liquor is paſt, and the ſuperfluous vapours refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:44773:192"/> therein, occaſioneth ſadneſſe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſullenneſſe, and heavineſſe. And this may be noted in many men, who at firſt, after they have drunke wine a while, are exceeding joviall, lively, and ſet upon a merry pin; but after when they have ſurcharged their ſtomacks, and when the heate of the wine is out of their braine, and the vapours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cooled therein, and diſtilled, they become exceeding ſad, heavie, dull, and diſcontented. As for example, a man that is potſhot (as they ſay) with good Sacke at night, look upon him next day in the morning, and ſee him like the picture of ill fortune, ſad, heavie, ſullen, quarrelſome, and diſcontented, and looking as if hee came lately out of Purgatory.</p>
                  <p>And theſe be the effects which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the ſpirits, of Sacke and ſtrong liquor (if abuſed) ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and practiſed by our brain-ſicke, diſſolute, roaring Gallants, Pot-Poets, and Bacchanalian Students, who uſe to tipple and talke Philoſophy in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:44773:192"/> the Taverne, and be addle-pated, and ready to ſleepe at their bookes, and in their ſtudy, when they come there, and where perchance they remaine exceeding ſad and melancholy till they returne to the Taverne againe. Hence it is that the frothy wits of many of theſe our Pot-blades, &amp; their loud cracklings of laughter doe ſtand at the courteſie of the Barrell. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sack &amp; good liquor their wits and ſpirits, like themſelves, are even all amort and defunct, chilled and frozen up, but tother quart or pottle revives them againe, and very likely ſets their wits, their ſpirits, and perchance their noſes afire together. But this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues not; this heate of mirth either is ſoone over-whelmed and drowned in their exceſſe, and then they become ſickiſh, adle-pated, quarrelſome, wild, or ſullen, or elſe is ſoone cooled and refrigerated in their braine, and then they become very ſad and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
                  <p>But ſee a further miſchiefe, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:44773:193"/> thus ingulpht in melancholy and diſcontent, will yet againe ſeeke to remedy themſelves by theſe drinking courſes which are indeede occaſions thereof, and ſo hinder themſelves from ſeeking or finding the true meanes to be eaſed of this their diſcontent and melancholy. It is reported of the <hi>Danes, Dutch-men, Polanders,</hi> and <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminans,</hi> that they will goe and drink downe their melancholy and griefe; ſo with us, many men will to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne and ſeeke out their joviall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, as they call them, to paſſe away the time in merriment, as they ſay, and to drinke away their melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and diſcontent; It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede that moderate drinking, mirth, and good company, is a very good remedy againſt diſcontent: But here's the miſchiefe, exceſſive drinking and abuſes in this kinde are occaſions to many men (as hath beene ſhewed) of their greater griefe and melancholy, and the remedies which they ſeeke herein to cure their diſeaſe by this
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:44773:193"/> meanes doth encreaſe the ſame, ſo as they doe but claw a ſcab that itches, and might otherwiſe be healed. After all theſe frivolous deferrings, their melancholy and griefe will returne and be worſe then before, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in many men, who by long cuſtome in ſuch abuſes, grow to ſuch an habit of melancholy and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as they become ſad, ſorrowfull, angry, froward, and quarrelſome, ſometimes even among their cuppes and merrieſt companions; and as King <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, even in laughter their hearts are ſorrowfull. So that it is onely exceſſive and abuſive drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king which is the cauſe of all this griefe, miſery, melancholy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, and ſo hindereth happineſſe therein: And if we could refraine only the exceſſes and abuſes thereof, it were a good remedy againſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and melancholy, and as hath been ſhewed, many good benefits and felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties would ſpring from the good and moderate uſe of drinking, and ſo wee
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:44773:194"/> might enjoy the ſame freely, and bee as good fellowes, as merry and as happy as may be; Of which more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>So it appeares by what hath beene ſaid, that to ſome men cold and moiſt, to others hot diſtempers both of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and minde, and to many men me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and ſadneſſe, are cauſed by exceſſive and abuſive drinking. Now I might adde, that to ſome a ſtrange mixture of diſeaſes and diſtempers are hereby cauſed, proceeding of cold, moiſt, hot, inflamed, corupted, and divers mixt cauſes in one body, in ſo much as ſome men therby become rheumaticke, groſſe, fat, lazie, dull, heavie, ſullen, melancholy, and full of cold diſtempers, and yet inflamed with heate and choler, and ſo alſo very wilde, teſty, braine-ſicke, chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, and froward, as appeares in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our tun-bellied Hoſts, Hoſteſſes ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> ſwill-bowles, &amp; others. In ſo much as many of them become eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> replete with ill humours in the body
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44773:194"/> and maligne diſpoſitions in the mind. Therefore let us by all meanes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew theſe abuſive drinking courſes.</p>
                  <p>Here let mee write of a common error in the world, by which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are deceived and led away to theſe drinking abuſes. The error is this, many men doe thinke the worſt drunkards to be the braveſt men; that is, men who can drinke abundance, and make a common cuſtome of it, and yet beare it well, and come off finely, as they ſay, and not reele, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, vomit, ſleepe, or the like; why, ſuch a man they commonly eſteeme no drunkard, or at leaſt not ſo bad as weake-brain'd, ſoone diſtempered drinkers, though theſe notable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrong-brain'd drinkers have ſuch gorges as to devoure as much as would ſuffice two or three families, who will glory to drinke it off, if it were a mile to the bottome, as they ſay, who will ſit from morning till night, or from thence till morning, drinke with all companies, and yet
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44773:195"/> ſcarce faile or blunke at it; And yet ſuch men forſooth are accounted no drunkards, but rather brave fellowes, the onely gallants and ſparkes; boone companions, Low-Counrey Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſtiffe blades, ſteele to the backe, and the like; yea, they are applauded and reputed by ſome the braveſt men in the Kingdome. Now the truth is, that ſuch ſtout, able, impudent, roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, fine, plauſible, methodicall, common ſtrong-brain'd drinkers, are commonly the worſt, moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, moſt exemplary drunkards, and moſt threatned in the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. To make this appeare more plainely. Firſt, as maybe noted, they are commonly as bad, or rather of worſe conditions then others of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker braines. It is true indeed, they all are bad, and that the weaker braind are more fraile and open, and ſo diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their faults and imperfections more apparently, and are then moſt fraile and faulty, when their braines are diſtempered. But theſe ſtrong
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44773:195"/> brain'd, fine, plauſible, common drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers are uſually (which is worſe) more ſlily, cunningly, cloſely, and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly vitious. Many of them can ſtrangely countenance and colour vice and lewdnes with brave ſhewes, with Art and faire termes, inſomuch as they can maintaine diſſolute courſes with a pernitious ſhew of a good face and good words, and ſeeme to bragge of, and glory in wickedneſſe. Yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them can impudently (as well as ſlily) maintaine vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and can outbeard goodneſſe, and ſeeme to daſh it out of countenance, and ſo openly and audaciouſly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vertue, piety, and the profeſſors thereof. And although they are poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick enough to carry themſelves faire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſome companies, and ſeeme then to be of good conditions; yet take them among their fellowes and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liars, ſuch as are of the ſame garb, ſuch as will ſeeme to approve of their courſes. and you may obſerve how diſſolute and impious they are, even
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44773:196"/> by their courſes, as among divers other their idle obſcene baudy talke, their ſwearing, curſing, ill wiſhes, ill coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, maintaining of vice, gybing, ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing at, and abuſing of piety and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; railing at and reproaching of Miniſters, Magiſtrates, and all good vertuous, pious men, all that live above their ſwiniſh, idle, diſſolute courſes. Secondly, they are more dangerous and exemplary; for weake brain'd drinkers, almoſt every one ſees their faults and imperfections, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples wherby men uſe to take heed; yea, even themſelves often are aſham'd of and diſlike themſelves, and often perchance repent, after they are ſober, and if they be not extreamely beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there is hope of amendment; but the ſtiffe able drinkers, ſuch as call themſelves boone companions, being more cunning, more plauſible, more liked of, accompanied, followed, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded and ſooth'd up in their ill courſes (and ſo become conceited therein) ſeldome repent or leave the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44773:196"/> ſame, but rather will boaſt, bragge of, and glory in theſe their idle, lewd, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious courſes. I wiſh there were not many Gentlemen of theſe ill condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but ſuch are indeed the ſhame of Gentlemen. And theſe notable, ſtiffe, able, ſtrong-brain'd common drinkers, plauſible blades, and as they call themſelves fine companions (though of many courſe conditions) are the principal occaſions that others are drawne to theſe ill courſes; and therefore moſt dangerous, and to bee avoyded. Thirdly, the Scriptures treating of drunkenneſſe in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt woes and threatnings thereof, chiefely and mainely aimeth at ſuch men as theſe; As for example, <hi>Woe</hi> (ſaith the Prophet <hi>to them that are mighty to drinke wine, and men of ſtrength to mingle ſtrong drinke, &amp;c. Eſay.</hi> 5.22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theres for ſtrong-brain'd, able, mighty, ſtout drinkers. Againe, <hi>Woe to them that riſe up early to follow ſtrong drinke, that continue untill night, till wine inflame them. Eſay.</hi> 5.11. alſo
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:44773:197"/> 
                     <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.30. Theres for them that riſe to be at it, and ſtay long by it. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, <hi>Woe to them that drinke by bowles, &amp;c. Amos</hi> 6.6. Theres for methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call drinkers, ſuch as drinke by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, by whole cups, healths, &amp;c. and will not leave ſo much as a pearle (as they ſay) behinde. Alſo <hi>Woe to them that go and ſeek out mixt wine, Prov.</hi> 23.30. Theres for walking Drinkers, that goe from one Pariſh, and from one tipling houſe to another to ſeeke it out. Alſo <hi>Woe be to him that provoketh his neighbour to drinke, and maketh him drunken;</hi> Theres for ſuch plauſible drinkers as allure, draw, or provoke others to drinking courſes, and for bragging victorious drinkers, that thinke it a brave thing to fox (as they ſay) or fuddle their neighbours and companions. Thus we ſee the moſt evill, pernitious, dangerous, exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, wofull, and miſerable drinkers, are the ſtrongbrain'd, able, devoted, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, methodicall, walking, plauſible, provoking, victorious drinkers, and
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:44773:197"/> that they are even worſe then weake-brain'd drinkers, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion and error whereby many thouſands are led to theſe abuſes.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let mee render ſome examples of the effects of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and abuſive drinking; and firſt for recreations ſake amidſt more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcourſe, a few merry or ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtories thereof, which I have read or heard of. One being foxt, and comming late over a bridge, chanced to fall into a ditch, knee-deepe in mud and water, where not being able to get out, fell aſleepe; towards mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning one comming by when he began to wake, heard him ſay aloud; Thou whore, why doeſt thou lay no more clothes upon my feete. Another ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a company come out of a Taverne doore, look'd up to ſee what ſigne it was, and with looking up, reeled and tumbled downe; being ſcrambled up againe; Gentlemen (ſaies he) pray what ſigne's this? One anſwered, a ſigne that you are foxt. Another very
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:44773:198"/> tall man being in a Winter night very late foxt, aſleepe in a chimney corner, where the mantle was very low; The hoſt not being able to wake him, went to bed and left him, where he lay till towards morning, and having ſoundly bepiſt himſelfe, awakes, riſes up, and not remembring where he was, being within the mantle, knocks his head firſt at the one ſide, then at the other within the chimney, and could not finde a way out; at laſt looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he ſaw light at the top of the chimney. and feeling himſelfe very wet and cold, apprehended that hee was fallen into a Well, and began to call very loud, and very pittifully for helpe; whereupon they in the houſe awak'd, wondered, roſe to helpe him in all haſte, but when they knew the matter, ſoundly laught at him. Again, a company being drinking in a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one of their heads ak'd, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſteale away from them into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother roome to ſleepe, found a paire of ſtaires, where hee goes up into an
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:44773:198"/> old garret juſt over their heads, which not being boorded, he dropt through the ſeiling juſt downe amongſt them againe; they were at firſt afraid, but after made good ſport in laughing at him. Another was ſo pittifully pot-ſhaken, that going to make water, hee tooke the end of his skirt in his hand and piſt in his britches. I hope you are wiſe enough to read theſe tales with a deteſtation of ſuch fooliſh and ridiculous actions, and the cauſe thereof, abuſive drinking, as well as for recreation. I might tell many more to this purpoſe, but theſe may ſuffice for a taſte of their rediculous courſes.</p>
                  <p>But now to write more ſadly, I might alſo tell many ſtories &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of hatefull miſchiefes and murders, that have beene the evill and miſerable effects of theſe drinking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes. But to ſpeake onely of a few, leſt in this briefe diſcourſe I become too tedious. A certaine man beating his wife in his drinke, broke her arme
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44773:199"/> and legge, and being rebuked for it, wiſht alſo he had broke her neck. The ſonne of <hi>Cyrill</hi> (in <hi>Hippo</hi>) in his drink would have violated his ſiſter, he beat his mother being great with childe, killed his father, and did other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes; Oh mighty domination of the Devill, ſaith Saint <hi>Augustine. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> in his drinke killed his deare friend <hi>Clitus,</hi> and being come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ('tis ſaid) he would have killed himſelfe for killing <hi>Clitus.</hi> Examples of murders, duels, ſtabs, wounds, ſad accidents, and of untimely death, are very frequently regiſtred and heard of, by reaſon of theſe drinking abuſes. And in our times, how many raſh, braine-ſicke, pot-valiant, ſwaſh-buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are there, that ſeeme to feare nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God, nor the Devill, nor hanging; that although commonly themſelves doe all the wrong, yet will bee ready to draw their Rapiers upon every ſlight occaſion (eſpecially when they get advantage of weapon or the like, and have ſome ready to backe them if
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44773:199"/> need bee looking on) and make no bones nor conſcience to venter dying, hanging, loſſe of Heaven, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for a trifle, and ſo to turne vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines, murderers, humane Devils, I cannot terme them too bad; and I feare not to anger the worſt of them with ſpeaking truth; And yet tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſome of theſe deſperate, pot-valourous, foole-hardy villaines (though they ſeeme to be the Devils Lievtenants) are oftentimes ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully beaten; And 'tis like if they were put upon a good cauſe, as the defence of their Prince and Country, that they would (like that drinking Army which the <hi>Romans</hi> ſo eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered) ſooneſt turne cowards, or like thoſe Engliſh men at the ſiege of <hi>Groyne</hi> in <hi>Gallizia,</hi> where many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred loſt their lives by reaſon of their drinking. So alſo I might write of divers ſtories and examples how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men come to untimely deaths in their drinke or by reaſon of drinking. <hi>Elah, Zimri, Olofernes,</hi> came to untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44773:200"/> ends in their drinke. So alſo (as Hiſtories report) did <hi>Fliolmus</hi> King of <hi>Gothes, Cleonicus</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemonia,</hi> King <hi>Hardecanutus</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and meaner perſons innumerable. Maſter <hi>Ward</hi> in a Printed Sermon telleth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſtories at large of above thirty ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall perſons in the Kingdome that came to very ſtrange and untimely deaths, by reaſon of abuſive drinking. And Maſter <hi>Stowe</hi> in his Annals tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth of a lamentable and remarkable accident of a hundred and eighty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that died in &amp; by exceſſive drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in leſſe then three daies ſpace. And how many men in our dayes by reaſon of abuſive and intemperate drinking (like <hi>Alexander</hi>) die even in the flower of their age, or at leaſt doe much ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their life.</p>
                  <p>I might further diſcourſe concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the evill and miſerable effects of drinking abuſes, concerning mens credit, eſtates, families, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and alſo Piety and Religion, but theſe would then extend this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:44773:200"/> too long, And alſo ſince many Authors have written thereof at large, I will now voluntarily omit the ſame and proceed.</p>

And here it is that they thinke themſelves in their Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>However ſuch outward provocations to ſuch men, as are not uſed to them, and to ſuch as can ſee through them, will juſtly ſeeme very ſlender, idle, and ridiculous; and ſome of them irkſome, vitious, impious and helliſh, yet to many thouſand braine-ſicke men in this age, they appeare ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as that they very weakely and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:44773:203"/> ſwiniſhly eſteeme ſuch courſes their choyſeſt recreation and ſoveraigne fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, wherein peradventure conſiſts their greateſt miſery as hath beene ſhewed. And to ſpeake more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Certainely, if there be any <hi>Dalilah</hi> on earth, 'tis ill company. If we uſe the ſame, they will ſo inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate into our minds, as 'tis very likely we ſhall firſt be drawne to a tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allowance, afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance to action, cuſtome, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their courſes, if we be not very cautelous, and wiſe enough to ſee the vanity, folly, ridiculouſnes, &amp; impiety thereof: Inſomuch as hath beene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that very few men who have long and much uſed ſuch drinking courſes have ever forſaken them, nor can they bee perſwaded thereunto by any meanes. And indeed if we more ſeriouſly think of it, it will appeare a marvellous hard matter for ſuch a man to forſake his chiefe delights, his old rooted cuſtomes, his habit, his very nature as I may ſay. Inſomuch as
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:44773:203"/> there had need to be preſcribed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall and divine remedies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert ſuch a man from himſelfe; and indeed, unleſſe a man have ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and divine Grace in him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as truely and ſeriouſly endeavour to forſake ſuch rooted cuſtomary habits; and hee that can but onely ſo endeavour (though hee often fall through frailty) is to bee well eſteemed inaſmuch as wee ſee in him a willing minde to forſake ill and doe well, which is the divine Grace of God in man, who accepteth the will for the deed, whoſe power (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) is made perfect through our weakneſſe and infirmities. And even in this life there are no actions more worthy of commendations then to endeavour as much as wee may to conquer our irregular affections, and ſo to become Lord of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>So alſo for a young man to bee tempted by ſuch and ſo many devices as are commonly uſed in this drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age, and that in his chiefe ſeaſon
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:44773:204"/> of temptation, if he doe but ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to avoid ſuch courſes, and ſo to become temperate, ſtaid, and frugall in theſe intemperate wild, and riotous times, he is to be thought a gratious ſpirit. And if he be of ſuch a divine temper, that by reaſon of the heavenly mirth and muſicke within his ſoule, he can bee above ſuch low pleaſures in compariſon, and ſo can contemne the common exceſſive ſwilling of many whole cups, and roaring, ſwearing, curſing, rayling, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, abuſing, gybing at good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ribaldiſh, ſcurrilous mirth, and loud gapings of laughter at ſuch bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſtuffe, as muſicke rather to pleaſe the Devill then him, and ſo avoids all ſuch ill courſes; how may health, proſperity, yea heaven and earth ſmile upon ſuch a man. And alſo to deride and ſcoffe at theſe idle tipling courſes, even in their owne colours and height of ſeeming felicity, is a maſter-peece.</p>
                  <p>Neither doe there want naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in this reſpect of drinking, to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:44773:204"/> alter the ill diſpoſition and temper of our bodies, and to rectifie the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly affections of our minds. As for example, if we be poſſeſt with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall thirſt and deſire of ſtrong and hot drinkes, wee may purge out that ſtrange mixture of cold, cla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>my, eagre, ſalt, and tart humours, which are the cauſes thereof. Or elſe wee may alter the ſame by diſuſe of the occaſions. Such men therefore as have uſed to drinke much Sacke and other ſtrong liquors, if by degrees they paſſe from a greater quantity to a leſſer, and ſo from hotter liquors to cooler (which is better then ſudden alterations and leſſe diſtempers the body) ſubſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the quantity and quality, by little and little, untill they come to a due proportion and order, their ſtomackes will then in good time bee ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted again, and fitted for this quantity and quality, as they will not any more be troubled with the former greedines thereof. And cuſtome in this kinde is of ſuch force that it maketh ſmall
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:44773:205"/> beere, yea water (as appeares in the enſuing alleadged examples) to ſome men equall in delight and pleaſantnes to the choyceſt dainties, wines and ſtrongeſt liquors to ſuch as uſually drinke no other.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſafe concerning bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly health, wholly to alter an old roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted naturall cuſtome. As for a man that hath beene much and long uſed to wine or ſtrong drinke, now to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare it altogether is not ſafe, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a reaſonable manner; for having brought his ſtomacke to a naturall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and deſire thereof; it is not amiſſe ſometimes within the limits of a due proportion, and temperance to che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh himſelfe therewith; eſpecially, if he be of declining and aged yeeres, or of a dull, ſlow, heavie, ſad diſpoſition; to refreſh and cheere his aged, decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and dejected ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>There bee alſo divers remedies to rectifie the minde herein, as to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the evill and miſerable effects of ſuch abuſive drinking (which are
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44773:205"/> treated of in divers Authors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the view of all men) eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our bodies and mindes, as hath beene declared; which truely to think on, is in reaſon ſufficient to flight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our irregular affections from ſuch exceſſe and abuſes.</p>
                  <p>Alſo to thinke how vaine, empty, and idle ſuch outward provocations are, which allure us to ſuch courſes; What are wee a pin the better to bee waited upon ſometimes a while by ſome (perchance miſreckoning, nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, frothing, cheating) Tapſter, Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or the like, who are aſwell ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to every idle deboiſt fellow as others, and whoſe ſervice is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but to make your purſe lighter? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo what are we a jot the better for keeping company with fawning flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and paraſites, then whom in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are not more dangerous people in the world? Or with diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute braine-ſicke phantaſticke pot-gallants? Or what are we a button the worſe for their common, ſilly pot-jeeres,

Methinkes it ſhould be as a divine conſort of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall muſicke to our eares, to heare ſuch men reproach and revile us; As hath beene formerly ſhew'd, it is a good and bleſſed ſigne; It ſeemes we are converted from their ill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and diſallow them. Alſo what are we the better to heare ſuch company, bragge, domineere, call themſelves good-fellowes, blades, and the like? Let us bee much rather diſliked, and reproached by ſuch men, for being temperate, ſober, civill, ſtayd, frugall vertuous and pious, then bladed and good-fellow'd with a hug for abuſing and ſpoyling our ſelves. And further,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:44773:206"/> what are wee the better to heare them roare, ſweare, curſe gybe, ſcoffe, ſing idle ſcurrilous ſongs, talk baudily &amp; to little purpoſe, and ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance as loud as they gape three or foure at once; or to ſee them ſmoke their noſes, ſit ſwilling off abundance of whole cups, perchance foure or five houres together, and piſſing it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, as if we knew no better actions? Or to obſerve the idle ſilly orders and devices of ſuch people, ſuch as are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up the cup to the brimma; drinke it off fairely, as they ſay, upon the naile, to the little finger, not to leave ſo much as a pearle behinde, or pin the basket; calling tother pint or jugge when wee have too much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; to ſee our ſelves pledg'd, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wet reckonings, enforcing of whole cups, healths, and the like: What need I particulariſe, almoſt all their pot devices and cuſtomes, (to a reaſonable man well in his wits, that is not beſotted therewith) ſeeme ſo vaine, abſurd, ſilly, and rediculous, as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44773:207"/> he is even wonder-ſtrucke to thinke that ſo many wiſe men of excellent parts, in all places, are ſo beſotted with ſuch ſilly devices, who otherwiſe truely (I meane the more worthy, courteous, wiſe, and generous ſort of ſuch as are uſually termed good-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, &amp;c.) doe as farre excell divers other niggardly, covetous, rugged, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociable, degenerate, and puny ſpirits, as Gold doth Earth, or the Sunne a Candle (untill they have ſpoyled themſelves by drinking) and ſo would be eſteemed, if they would not uſe ſuch degenerate courſes.</p>
                  <p>Further to rectifie our minds here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, let us know, that we may ſtill drink ſuch and ſo much as is neceſſary, yea, moſt pleaſant, delightfull, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall in all reſpects (as is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and which is ſuch a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is to be dilated in the enſuing Sections, inſomuch as we may be, as merry therein, and as good-fellowes, yea, much better companions then in exceſſe and abuſes (if wee had reaſon
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:44773:207"/> to ſee it) and be happy therein.</p>
                  <p>I pray Sir, pardon me, if you thinke I have written any thing too bitterly and tartly. Indeed I have beene very ſparing (except in ſome few very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary places) of groſſe and ſower termes, in reſpect of ſome Authors, who have written of this ſubject, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſame will the rather worke upon courteous, faire conditioned, kind, free, wiſe, pleaſant, &amp; ſociable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſuch as I know many are, who are too much inclined and moſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to thoſe drinking abuſes: and if you thinke I have writ any thing too jeſting or gybingly; who will blame me (but ſuch as are too ſevere) if I have written the truth in a pleaſant way; and I hope this alſo will the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter worke upon ſuch natures before named. And in good earneſt now, (concerning my ſelfe) I confeſſe that I love ſometimes to drinke two or three cups of wine, or good liquor for recreation among my friends, and although I diſlike our common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44773:208"/> drinking courſes, and ſome ſilly pernitious devices and cuſtomes of this drinking age, and alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I love to bee civill, and to heare other men talke more then my ſelfe; yet truely I thinke very well of mirth and good-fellowſhip in good ſort, and it doth me much good to ſee and heare men drinke, ſing, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, be joyfull, pleaſant, and merry without abuſes. But I proceed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O the intent that wee may bee happy in reſpect of drinking, let us uſe the ſame in ſuch ſort as by a right ordering and moderating of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeverall kinde of drinke, by ſutable
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44773:208"/> degrees and convenient proportions, the ſame may tend to our well being. Such a moderation and proportion I meane, as is very eaſie to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, pleaſant and beneficiall; ſo much as brings ſtrength and vigor, both in minde and body, and on the contrary not ſo much as is trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or breeding diſtemper therein.</p>
                  <p>To treate thereof briefely, it is beſt for young men, cholericke and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine complexions, uſually to drinke coole, ſmall, and milde wine, beere, or ale; And to avoid ſuch as is very ſtrong, hot, ſtale; and ſower, as much as they may. And for the phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, groſſe, fat, and melancholy men, it is beſt commonly to drinke ſuch wine and beere as is thin, piercing, and pure; And to forbeare new, thick, ſweete, and muddy ſtuffe.</p>
                  <p>A cup or two of Sacke, Metheglin, ſtrong Beere, Ale, or other good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor is not amiſſe for old, weake, and decayed men; and for ſuch as are heavie, ſad, and ſorrowfull, ſometimes
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44773:209"/> to comfort their drooping ſpirits: yet too much ſtrong and hot liquors (by reaſon of the ſuperfluous multitude of vapours, exhaling to the braine, remaining unconcocted, and after the heate thereof is paſt, are there refrige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into cold phlegme) doth cauſe even to old, ſad, and drooping men, a greater heavineſſe and melancholy. However a reaſonable quantity doth much cheere, quicken, and revive them.</p>
                  <p>The quantity moſt convenient is ſo much as by reaſon and our own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, doth make our bodies and mindes apt and healthy to performe their offices, and no way diſtempers or hinders them. But for as much as our appetite is deceitful (eſpecially if by cuſtome we get an ill diſpoſition in the ſtomacke) and is alwayes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing for ſenſuality, blinding our reaſon and carrying us beyond the due meaſure of temperance and welfare; Let us therefore conſider a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and meaſure.</p>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:44773:209"/>
                  <p>Phyſitians ſay that uſually three or foure reaſonable draughts at a meale is ſufficient for any man, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene meales it is not good to drink above the ſame proportion. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of three draughts at a time, at the moſt, was determined by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Nants,</hi> as being ſufficient in nature and reaſon for any man; and the ſame is approved of by divers Philoſophers, Poets, and others. Or if you will (according to the laudable cuſtome of ſome men) now and then for recreation ſit in a Taverne or Ale-houſe till you have dranke each man his pint of wine, or jug of beere, or thereabouts, and no more, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; ſo as the ſame be onely ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (not commonly) and onely for good recreation or occaſion, and without abuſes.</p>
                  <p>But foraſmuch as a different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is to be allotted in reſpect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ime, age, complexion, and the like, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>his may eaſily be (and commonly is naturally) remedied either by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44773:210"/> greater or leſſer draughts, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a draught or two more in a day, when and to whom it is requiſite. As in Summer more then in Winter, the cholericke more then the phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke, ſo as it bee not too ſtrong or hot; children uſually drinke leſſer draughts then men; labourers may drinke more, and more often then idle people: So to drinke when naturall thirſt requires (if the body be not too hot, or diſtempered) is good, for very much thirſt is ill for the ſtomack, and it is good that the ſame be common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept cleane, and ſometimes moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Phyſitians alſo ſay, it is not good to drinke betweene meales, till after the firſt concoction, or till two or three houres after the meale (unleſſe much thirſt require) eſpecially for ſuch as are phlegmaticke. But ſome thinke a good draught or two of warme beere taken halfe an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore meales is a good preparative for the ſtomacke, eſpecially for ſuch as are dry and thirſty.</p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:44773:210"/>
                  <p>Neither doth it much matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning bodily health, if ſometimes we be drawne to digreſſe a little from ſuch a due order and proportion. To exceed ſometimes this quantitie, and water the body by a more liberall drinking then uſuall, is by ſome thought not amiſſe for health, ſo as the ſame be done but very ſeldome, and ſo as we preſently return again to our wonted and uſuall ſobriety; for ſuch accidental and ſeldome exceſſes are of little prejudice to health: And in this reſpect it is not good over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrupulouſly, and too preciſely to tye our ſelves to an exact proportion, leſt we contract our ſtomackes to ſuch an habit as will not admit of any errours when they happen without diſtempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, but long and often exceſſes are very pernitious. However it is good to have our mindes directed to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, preciſe, and exact meaſure, and to have the ſame (as a patterne) dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently marked, and imprinted in our mindes, to the intent that wee may
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44773:211"/> imitate the ſame, or come as neer ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto as we may, without too much niceneſſe and inconvenience, knowing that all vertue is moſt really and beſt performed when we obſerve the ſame in a perfect manner. And alſo let us the rather as neere as we can conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, moſt willingly apply our minds thereunto, knowing that ſuch a due proportion and order as is before mentioned, is very ſufficient, eaſie, pleaſant, and moſt beneficiall, as now followeth to be declared.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, that the ſame due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and order of drinking is ſufficient and eaſie to be undergone appeares, inaſmuch as a well tempered nature requires no more; for what reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man (who hath not by ill cuſtome altered his nature) deſires to drinke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or foure draughts at a time, or (if you will) above a pint a wine or an uſuall jug of beer for his part at a ſitting, or otherwiſe any way out of good order; inſomuch as he thinkes it an eaſie and pleaſant thing to bee
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44773:211"/> temperate, whereas all intemperance and diſorder diſpleaſes, and very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtempers him; yea, even brute, irrationall creatures are contented with and deſire no more then ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie: It is onely an unraſonable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and perhaps corrupted by ill cuſtome that makes us deſire more, for wee know that one or two draughts at once, is ſufficient to quench thirſt, and ſuffice nature.</p>
                  <p>And that we may the rather know how largely ſufficient and eaſie ſuch a due proportion and order of drinking is; Let me tell you how ſome learned Phyſitians and others doe preſcribe farre more ſtrict rules therein: as that children, cholericke, and young men ſhould not at all drinke any hot or ſtrong wine. That foureteene or ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ounces of drinke in a day is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. That above three draughts at a time is madneſſe, and the like; now if wiſe men have thought ſuch over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, and too ſtrict rules and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances to be good; then ſurely that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44773:212"/> which is better, more reaſonable, and much larger is very ſufficient, and eaſie to be obſerved. So concerning exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. We read of divers men in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, as commonly before the flood, and long after, and ſince the ſect of <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> alſo the <hi>Iberians,</hi> ſome of the Indians, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries, that dranke onely water, and yet were luſty, ſtrong, and well pleas'd therewith. So likewiſe of <hi>Philadelphus</hi> King of <hi>Egypt, Bernice</hi> Queene of <hi>Syria, Porus</hi> and <hi>Phaotes</hi> two Kings of <hi>India,</hi> of <hi>Anchimolus</hi> and <hi>Moſchus</hi> two Philoſophers, of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the Academicke, of <hi>Archonides, Mago</hi> of <hi>Carthage, Andrew</hi> of <hi>Argos, Iulius Viator</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, <hi>Laſyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Laſionus,</hi> and of <hi>Iulian</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Saba,</hi> that is, old man; Alſo of Saint <hi>Anthony,</hi> and of divers Hermits, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorits, and others, who would drink no other but water, (as likewiſe many men of later times) and yet lived very healthy, ſtrong, and to a very old age; Nor did they deſire any other drinke,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44773:212"/> being uſed to this, but thought the ſame (to their taſte and uſe) much better then ſtronger liquors. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were ſuperſtition, rigidnes, and folly in us to uſe ſuch a ſevere courſe, unleſſe the temperature of our bodies required the ſame. Yet this we may learne, that if ſuch a more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid and ſtrict courſe, as to drinke ſo ſparingly, and that only water, be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, eaſie, and pleaſant to them which are accuſtomed thereunto, much more many ſuch nouriſhing and pleaſant drinks as our Countrey uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affords, and ſuch a larger proportion as is preſcribed ſuffice, and be very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerved by reaſonable men.</p>
                  <p>Further, let us conſider the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie and benefits of ſuch a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and order, which doth not onely preſerve us from a multitude of evils and miſeries, which exceſſe and diſorder cauſeth, as hath beene ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but it is alſo ſufficient in the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt degree to afford all benefits in reſpect of ſociety outwardly, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="324" facs="tcp:44773:213"/> the body and minde inwardly, that can with reaſon be expected thereby.</p>
                  <p>And firſt in reſpect of ſociety, or good-fellowſhip as we call it; Is not ſuch a due proportion as ſufficient as a greater quantity to maintaine amity and friendſhip by mutuall entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, courteſies, and expreſſions of love in drinking to, and pledging of one another? He is an unmannerly, unreaſonable, and in this reſpect worſe then brutiſh friend, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires above foure or five draughts at once for an entertainment or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. So alſo, at feaſts, banquets, and merry meetings, to ſeaſon our diſcourſes and mirth, ſomtimes with two or three cups of wine, or good liquor round about (ſo as without compulſion, as at <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> feaſt, every man drinke no more then hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) as at the marriage feaſt in <hi>Cana</hi> of <hi>Galile</hi> to cheere the heart, is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe. And is not this well and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficient, why ſhould wee deſire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>re? Or if we will to the Taverne
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44773:213"/> or Tap-houſe goe to meete with our friends for good recreation, or on other good occaſions, may wee not be good-fellowes, and diſcourſe, ſing, laugh, bee merry, and uſe ſometimes honeſt diſports, as well with ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie as with exceſſe? And (as in our Grand-fathers dayes men were wont to do) now &amp; then ſitting and talking an houre or two (upon the like good occaſion or convenient recreation) over a pint or two of wine, or each man his pint or jug at the moſt, and that onely with good and harmeleſſe company, who doe hatefully baniſh from their faire and honeſt ſociety, all riot, murmurs, quarrels, curſings, ſwearing, intemperance, and abuſes; and where each mans tongue plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly trowles in harmeleſſe manner, where the Muſes and ſweete mirth agree; And now and then when each man pleaſes in a temperate manner to adde a cup or two of wine as a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall to ſweeten and quicken all the mirth. I pray tell me, is not this far
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44773:214"/> better then to ſit, according to the uſuall cuſtome of our times, roaring, bragging, quarrelling, talking baudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſwearing, curſing, ſmoaking, and in an unreaſonable ſort to ſit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times five or ſixe houres or longer continually ſwilling and guzelling whole cups as faſt as wee can drinke, and piſſing it out againe, as if wee knew no better actions.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe concerning the body, ſuch a moderate and due proportion and order is largely ſufficient, and moſt beneficiall to ſuſtaine and preſerve nature, to fortifie and warme the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, to cauſe good digeſtion and concoction of meate, to refreſh, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and moiſten the moſt dejected and dryeſt body, to comfort and ſtrengthen age and weakeneſſe, and to encreaſe beauty and cheerefulneſſe; wheras exceſſe and abuſes, as hath bin ſhew'd, ſpoileth, ſurchargeth, annoieth, corrupteth, puffeth up, inflameth, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempereth, over-whelmeth, or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the body in all theſe felicities.</p>
                  <pb n="327" facs="tcp:44773:214"/>
                  <p>And to the minde in like manner, the ſame due proportion and order is ſufficient to allay griefe and qualifie cares, in a farre better manner then exceſſe and diſorder can; and ſo to quicken the minde and make it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, lively, and cheerefull, whereas exceſſe and abuſes dulleth and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers the braine, and encreaſes melancholy and ſadneſſe after the heate of the liquor is paſt, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours thereof cooled in the braine, as hath beene ſhew'd; beſides many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annoyances.</p>
                  <p>And is not then a temperate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and order moſt ſufficient, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, pleaſant, and beneficiall, how much better is it then by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and abuſes to annoy our bodies and mindes, and bring upon our ſelves a multitude of ill &amp; miſerable effects.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44773:215"/> And once againe let me ſay, that within the limits of this moſt excellent vertue of temperance let us ſtill be good-fellowes, as merry, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pleaſant as may be; ſince it is alſo a good and comely thing ſo to doe. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.18. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſince we are alſo adviſed to eate and drink with merry hearts, &amp;c. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.7.

Oh bleſſed Redeemer, ſweete Jeſus, we pray thee
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:44773:216"/> (with that woman of <hi>Samaria) give us of this water, verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>this living water, Iohn</hi> 7.38. which is thy holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Spirit. <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. Oh happy may wee bee then, to enjoy this heavenly fountaine, the God of conſolations within us. We may enjoy even rivers of living water, <hi>verſ.</hi> 39. Mee thinkes I now taſte thereof within me. I am all in a divine Muze, full of joyfull, glorious, heavenly thoughts, in conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of theſe ſoule-raviſhing words and ſentences of our bleſſed and moſt gracious Saviour, ſo full of delectation and ſweetneſſe, that ſuch as have heavenly ſoules to taſte and reliſh the pleaſantneſſe thereof, may be often (much better then with choyſeſt wine) cheered and quickned, and ſo often filled with heavenly joyes and delectations; ſuch a mans ſoule is often full of glading vivifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and divine ſoule-quickning ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiations (ſuch as meere worldlings are not acquainted with) inſomuch as they can (with Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) bee filled
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:44773:217"/> with conſolations, and abound with joyes even in the midſt of tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and (with Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> and other heavenly Martyrs) even in death it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, as there is a ſpirituall thirſt and a ſpirituall drinke; ſo alſo there may be as it were a kinde of ſpirituall drunkenneſſe in the Saints of God. A holy madneſſe as a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cals it, that is, when the ſoule is elevated and quickned with a divine taſte of the heavenly pleaſures in this life, as it is above, and even beſides it ſelfe with joy and delights. It ſeemes Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was in this extaſie when he could not tell whether he was in his body or not. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. And St. <hi>Peter</hi> having taſted of this heavenly Nectar, ſeemes to ſay hee knowes not what; <hi>Maſter</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>It is good for us to be here. Let us build three Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, one for thee, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeemes he was tranſported beſide himſelfe, having but taſted of this heavenly Nectar of divine and glorious conſolations.</p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:44773:217"/>
                  <p>And if we alſo could drink ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently therof, it would ſweetly enchant our ſoules and bring us into a moſt pleaſing extaſie of heavenly joy; yea, even but to thinke thereof truly, were ſufficient to make us all amazed and tranſported with heavenly amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; delectations, not being able to finde bounds nor meaſure in this divine joy and happineſſe; the ſame would ſo ſweetly and gloriouſly cheere, quicken, enlighten, and elevate our ſpirits, as it would make us even of a divine and heavenly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per already.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, let us acknowledge; In thee, O Lord, is the fulneſſe of this heavenly water of life, thoſe eternall rivers of pleaſures. Oh heavenly, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord God, ſince in thee is all ſweetneſſe, all pleaſures, all happines, Oh let it be the onely thirſt, deſire, and delight of my ſoule to enjoy thee; let this joy in thee be my heaven upon earth.</p>
